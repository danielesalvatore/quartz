The waterfall approach is an ordered series of steps.

Phases:
- Initiating
- Planning
- Execution and completion of the tasks
- Closing out the projects

When you want to use waterfall:
- When the phases of the project are clearly defined
- When there are tasks to complete before another can begin
- When changes to the project are very expensive when it has started
