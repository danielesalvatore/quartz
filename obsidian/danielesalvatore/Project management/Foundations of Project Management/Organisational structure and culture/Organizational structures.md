How members of the organization relate to and interact with one another
- Classic structure
- Matrix structure

# Classic structure
- May find yourself with less authority and limited scope.
- Rely on approval from the appropriate managers, directors, and department heads in order to move forward and complete tasks
- A project manager may require the appropriate managers' approval to get human resources.
- You may go through a chain of approval in case additional resources are required

# Matrix structure
- The chain of command isn't always as clearly defined as in the Classic structure
- May share resources cross-project, and therefore a project manager has to negotiate for their availability
- Emphasize a strong project focus
- Projects should be approved in advance, but when approved they should go smoothly
