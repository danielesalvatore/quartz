Types of [[Project]] to avoid:
- Never-ending projects
- Abandoned projects

# Never-ending projects
- They exist when the project deliverables and tasks cannot be completed.
- As a project manager, you must protect the [[Project scope]] to avoid becoming a never-ending project.  
# Abandoned projects
- When inadequate handoff or transition on the project deliverables occurs.
