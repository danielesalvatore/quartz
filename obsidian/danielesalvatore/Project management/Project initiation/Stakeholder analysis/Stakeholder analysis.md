Analysis:
- Make a list of all the [[Stakeholders]] the project impacts
- Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder
    - Interest is how much are the needs of the stakeholder affected by the project operations and outcomes
    - Influence measures how much power a stakeholder has and how much this stakeholder’s action affects the project outcome
- Assess stakeholders’ ability to participate and then find ways to involve them

Beyond clarifying who your stakeholders are, the stakeholders' analysis helps:
- How the stakeholders prefer to communicate
- What stakeholders’ priorities are
- How strongly to prioritize a particular stakeholder's needs and goals
