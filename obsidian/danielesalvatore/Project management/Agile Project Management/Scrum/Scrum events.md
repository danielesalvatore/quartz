# Timeboxes
Events are timeboxed:
- Create a sense of urgency that will drive prioritization
- Provide a window of focus that will translate into productivity gains
- Help the team develop a predictable rhythm to their work

How to define your timebox:
- Think about what you expect the frequency of changes to be
- Think about how much focused time your solution [[Development team (or Developers)]] needs to build a [[Product backlog]] item. 
- Think about how much overhead goes into the "delivery" of your product
