The measure of how many points the team burns down in a given [[Sprint]].

Often calculated as the average of the last three sprints. 

It is impossible to compare teams' velocity, as it strictly depends on the calibration of the [[Estimates#Relative estimations]]

Once you have a stable velocity, you can say to [[Stakeholders]]:
- How long it will take to complete the entire [[Product backlog]]
- How much of your [[Product backlog]] will be completed by a particular time.

- Be careful when sharing velocity with external [[Stakeholders]], as velocity is different for every team and cannot be compared
- Don't use velocity as a performance metric
- Don't use velocity as a comparison metric
- Proceed with caution when using velocity as a metric for project delivery date
