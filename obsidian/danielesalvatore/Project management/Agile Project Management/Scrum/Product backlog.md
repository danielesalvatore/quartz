The central artifact in [[Scrum]], where all possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are captured for the team to work on.

Product backload is the single authoritative source for things that a team works on and contains all of the features, requirements, and activities associated with deliverables to achieve the [[Project goals]].

The equivalent in project management is the setup of [[Project requirements]].

- Owned and adjusted by the [[Product owner]].

# Refinement
Backlog refinement is the act of keeping the [[Product backlog]] described, estimated, and prioritized so that the Scrum Team can operate effectively.

## Product backlog review
Review the [[Product backlog]] to ensure:
	- It contains the appropriate items, and nothing news is needed or nothing needs to be removed.
	- Ensure that the items are prioritized by the [[Product owner]], this is also called setting the order field
	- That the items at the top of the [[Product backlog]] are ready for delivery with clear acceptance criteria
	- And that the [[Product backlog]] items include estimates or an informed assessment about how much work a particular item will require
