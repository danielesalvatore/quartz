Frameworks:
- [[Scrum of Scrums]]
- [[Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)]]
- [[Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)]]
- [[Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)]]
- [[The Spotify Model]]


# Best practices
- Treat scaling models like SAFe, Scrum of Scrums, LeSS, etc., as general frameworks, not instruction manuals. 
- Different situations require different solutions. It’s okay to mix and match elements from multiple frameworks, as long as you apply the principles and values of the [[Agile manifesto]].
- Don’t try to scale without prior [[Agile]] experience. Going straight from Waterfall to scaled Agile can be risky without a knowledgeable guide.
- Finally, and most importantly, don’t scale if it isn’t necessary. The larger your team, the more complex and difficult your project becomes.
