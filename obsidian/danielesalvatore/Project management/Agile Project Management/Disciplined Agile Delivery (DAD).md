Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) is a hybrid approach that combines the strategies from various Agile frameworks, including Kanban, LeSS, Lean Development, Extreme Programming, Agile Modeling, and more. 

DAD guides people through the process-related decisions that frameworks like SAFe and Scrum of Scrums leave open. DAD helps you develop a scaled Agile strategy based on context and desired outcomes. 

DAD is organized into four “layers”:
- Foundations discuss the principles, guidelines, Agile concepts, roles and team structure definitions, and Way of Working (WoW).
- Disciplined DevOps ensures that solutions are delivered to customers effectively and safely, with data and security management always at the forefront.
- Value Streams ensures that solutions are aligned with the organization's business strategy, connecting customers, sales, and portfolio management to the framework.
- Disciplined Agile Enterprise (DAE) connects the industry marketplace with corporate governance and larger enterprise activities.
