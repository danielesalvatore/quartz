Common challenges:
- Managing a stable [[Product roadmap]]
- Incomplete implementation of [[Scrum]]
- Experiencing a lack of stability within the team 

# Managing a stable product roadmap
Unstable roadmap causes:
- Product ambition
- Product assumptions

## Product ambition
Example:
- Product leadership is overly ambitious about what the team can realistically deliver

Solutions:
- Agree up front how to handle new opportunities
- Set up regular roadmap reviews with the entire team
- Promote sharing knowledge between the [[Product owner]] and the [[Development team (or Developers)]]

## Product assumptions
Too many assumptions can jeopardize the team's success.

Solutions:
- Document the assumptions and make them transparent
- Check assumptions against unbiased user research
	- Gather information about what users really want
	- Allows you to confirm or reject assumptions

# Incomplete implementation of Scrum
- Loss of clear [[Scrum roles]] and responsibilities
- Tempted to skip some events or blend them to save time
- Not providing the team with the [[Scrum]] coaching they need
	- [[Coaching an Agile team]]

Solutions:
- Implement [[Scrum]] completely
- Make sure [[Scrum roles]] are well defined and properly fulfilled

# Experiencing a lack of stability within the team 
- Change in team composition

Solutions:
- Quick onboarding process
- Pair programming
- Have shorter [[Sprint]]
