Coaching:
- Design the "plays" with the team
- Provide feedback to the team
- Celebrate and learn with the team

# Design the "plays" with the team
Although the [[Scrum Master]] owns the playbook of [[Scrum]], it should be created with the whole team. 

# Provide feedback to the team
Provide feedback to [[Stakeholders]] and the team as early as possible. 
Both positive and negative feedback, as during [[Retrospective]].

# Celebrate and learn with the team
Acknowledge the achievement of the team.
