Introducing [[Agile]] to an organization:
- Creating a sense of ownership
	- Find an executive sponsor who also feels a sense of ownership for the change you're creating.
	- Having buy-in from someone at the top increases your chances of successfully driving any change in [[Organizational culture]]
- Creating a sense of urgency
	- Ask questions about what's working and what's not working right now
