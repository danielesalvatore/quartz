Another approach you may encounter is the “Spotify Model,” which we discussed in a previous reading. It is important to note that Spotify’s model is not a true Agile framework. There is no standard guide on how to implement it. The model began as a description of how Spotify overcame the challenges of scaling Agile. By focusing their efforts on culture, team autonomy, communication, accountability, and quality, they increased their agility over time. Spotify’s approach has had a huge impact on workflows and team structures across the tech world. 

Some of the key components include:
- Squads: Like Scrum teams, Squads are autonomous teams of 6–12 people working toward the same outcome. All Squads include a coach (similar to a Scrum Master) and a Product Owner.
- Tribes: When multiple Squads work on the same feature area, they form a Tribe of 40–150 people. Each Tribe has a Tribe Lead who fosters collaboration and coordination.
- Chapters: Squads may be autonomous, but specialists (e.g., JavaScript developers) should still align across an organization. Chapters establish best practices and, where necessary, set standards. 
- Guilds: Any group of people interested in a certain topic can form a Guild, where people with shared interests can come together as a community. 

While some organizations have had success with this model, be aware that it evolved from Spotify’s already significant Agile experience. It is the product of extensive introspection and adaptation and draws heavily on the company’s culture of trust, transparency, and autonomy. Therefore, the value of Spotify’s approach to scaling is not in team names like Squads and Tribes but in how they developed practices that supported and served their organizational culture.
