Roadmap:
- A high-level view of the expected product and its requirements
- Estimated schedule for reaching milestones

# Benefits
- Clarifying the sequence of deliverables 
- Showing teams how their efforts relate to the north-star vision. In other words, their ultimate goal. 
- Showing stakeholders the incremental value that will be achieved over the course of the project (rather than reviewing it as one big delivery at the end)
- Helping stakeholders roughly understand the layout of the work behind the deliverable

# Pitfalls
- Letting stakeholders think the roadmap is set and unchangeable. This may cause stakeholders to impede teamsâ€™ ability to adapt in response to new information, as well as put a lot of pressure on teams to achieve deadlines no matter what it takes.
- Spending too much time fine-tuning delivery dates versus keeping them rough and improving specificity as the dates get closer
- Putting all the work into creating the roadmap rather than producing the deliverables 

# Best practices
- Make it highly noticeable to the team and refer to it frequently.
- Clearly indicate the highest priority items.
- If possible, clearly indicate the highest value items.
- Make it visible to your wider stakeholder group so that they can use it for their planning. 
- Conduct regular reviews of the roadmap with sponsors, stakeholders, and the team to ensure that it is still providing the blueprint for the project.

# Tips
- Ensure product release dates are only rough estimates
