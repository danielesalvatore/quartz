Data ethics is the study and evaluation of moral challenges related to data collection and analysis. 
This includes generating, recording, curating, processing, sharing, and using data in order to come up with ethical solutions.

Businesses apply data ethics practices so they can:
- Comply with regulations
- Show that they are trustworthy
- Ensure fair and reasonable data usage
- Minimize biases
- Develop a positive public perception


## Data privacy
Data privacy deals with the proper handling of data. This includes the purpose of data collection and processing, privacy preferences, the way organizations manage personal data and the rights of individuals. It focuses on making sure the ways we collect, process, share, archive, and delete data are all in accordance with the law.

## Data bias
Make sure that the data you collect does not indicate any biases. Data bias is a type of error that tends to skew results in a certain direction.

Type of bias:
- Sampling bias is when a sample is not representative of the population as a whole. For example, maybe your sample did not include people above the age of 65. Or maybe you excluded people from certain socioeconomic groups.
- Observer bias is the tendency for different people to observe things differently. For example, stakeholders from different parts of the world might view the same data differently and draw different conclusions from it. 
- Interpretation bias is the tendency to always interpret situations that donâ€™t have obvious answers in a strictly positive or negative way, when, in fact there is more than one way to understand the data. Data that does not provide an obvious set of conclusions makes some people feel anxious, which can lead to interpretation bias. For example, a team member might interpret inconclusive survey results negatively, while other team members might be able to think more carefully and assess the data from different angles. 
- Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs. For example, you might ask only specific stakeholders for feedback on parts of your project because you know they are the most likely to have the same perspective as you.
