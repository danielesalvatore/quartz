Risk mitigation is a strategy to prepare for and lessen the effects of threats faced by a business. 

Four types of risk mitigation strategies:
- Avoid
- Minimize
- Transfer
- Accept

# Avoid
- Sidestep, or avoid, the situation as a whole. 
# Minimize
- Mitigating the risk involves trying to minimize the effect risks can have on a project. 
- It is possible to leverage a Decision Tree.
# Transfer
- The shift of responsibility of handling the risk to someone else. 
# Accept
- Accept the risk as the normal cost of doing business
	- Active acceptance: of risk usually means setting aside extra funds to pay your way out of trouble
	- Passive acceptance of risk is the “do nothing” approach.
