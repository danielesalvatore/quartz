If you don't ell your stakeholders about important risks, they may be less equipped to help you if an issue arises. 

Failing to communicate risks to stakeholders can erode their trust in you as the leader of the project. 

Communicate early and often with stakeholders about the medium- and high-level risks.

How you communicate risks to stakeholders depends on the severity of the risk.
- Low
	- An email may be enough
- Medium
	- A direct email, increase the level of communication and include additional details
- High
	- The serious nature of high-level risks requires a thorough and direct level of communication.
