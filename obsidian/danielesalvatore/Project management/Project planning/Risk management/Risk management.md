Risk management provides an understanding of:
- What could go wrong
- Who you'll need to consult
- How the risk could be mitigated

If you don't plan ahead, you may put your project at risk of not meeting its project goal, its timelines, or its success criteria. 

By failing to plan for risk, you also fail to think through the many different ways that your project could pivot and still meet its goals, even if an issue does arise.

Risks can affect projects in various ways that are difficult to foresee.
