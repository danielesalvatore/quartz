An opportunity is a potentially positive outcome of a [[Risk]]. 

To identify an opportunity, apply the same phases of the [[Risk management phases]].

Example of opportunities:
- Completing a milestone ahead of schedule
- Discounted materials 
- Availability of additional resources (people, investments, equipment)
