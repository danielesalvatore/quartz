An important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.

Why milestones are important:
- Setting milestones gives you a clear understanding of the amount of work your project will require. 
- Milestones help you keep the project on track.
- Milestones help uncover areas where you might need to adjust scope, timelines, or [[Project resources]] to meet your goals
- Reaching milestones can seriously motivate your team, and illustrate real progress to your stakeholders

Milestone must be completed on time and in sequential order.

# How to set milestones
- The first step to setting a milestone is to evaluate your project as a whole.
	- Leverage the [[Project charter]]
- Pick important progress 
- Once you've determined your milestones, the next step is to assign each one a deadline
	- Also consider the need of stakeholders

Setting tasks can help you clearly define milestones. You can do this in two ways:
- Top-down scheduling: In this approach, the project manager lays out the higher-level milestones, then works to break down the effort into project tasks. The project manager works with their team to ensure that all tasks are captured.
- Bottom-up scheduling: In this approach, the project manager looks at all of the individual tasks that need to be completed and then rolls those tasks into manageable chunks that lead to a milestone.
