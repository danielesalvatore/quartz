# How to create relationship with remote team

Refactoring meeting notes

Buddy Bergen approach applied to new contracted employee, to pair.

When organising and event, when to have it is important and frequency as well. Do not organise events when the team is stressed (e.g. end of a sprint)  

Memeâ€™s dump: ask to produce meme all along the week and at the end of the week to show them all together. At the end of the end, print a book with the best ones.

People love to be silly, but they do not want to be the first to be silly.
