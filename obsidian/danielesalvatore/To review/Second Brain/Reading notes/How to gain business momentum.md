# How to gain business momentum

Processes that improve the quality of execution, to meet expected standards, everything related to how work is done

Processes that align with the business, business sustainability target, how to make the business sustainable

People process, how to make people engaged and let them grow (avoid biases, and treat people equally)

The three are interconnected:

- you have great goals and you have great execution but toxic environment, you'll loose all the people
- if you have great [[Project management/Agile Project Management/Mission]], great people but poor execution your business will not grow
- if you have great execution and great people, but you don't know where you are going you are not going to be successful as a business.
