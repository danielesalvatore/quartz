# Focus week in Twitter

Tags: productivity

A week in which the Twitter staff is cleared by recurring meeting and it's allowed to work on things important for them (unblock previous work, completed unfinished tasks, etc).

After each focus week iteration, organisers gather feedback from Twitter employees to adjust the focus week modalities and people preferences.
