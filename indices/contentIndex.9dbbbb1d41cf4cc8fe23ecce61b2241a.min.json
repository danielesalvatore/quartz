triumphs and disasters","content":"This reading focuses on why accurate interpretation of data is key to data-driven decisions. You have been learning why data is such a powerful business tool and how data analysts help their companies make data-driven decisions for great results. As a quick reminder, the goal of all data analysts is to use data to draw accurate conclusions and make good recommendations. That all starts with having complete, correct, and relevant data. \n\nThis illustration shows a magnifying glass viewing binary numbers and the word ERROR.\nBut keep in mind, it is possible to have solid data and still make the wrong choices. It is up to data analysts to interpret the data accurately. When data is interpreted incorrectly, it can lead to huge losses. Consider the examples below.\n\nCoke launch failure\nIn 1985, New Coke was launched, replacing the classic Coke formula. The company had done taste tests with 200,000 people and found that test subjects preferred the taste of New Coke over Pepsi, which had become a tough competitor. Based on this data alone, classic Coke was taken off the market and replaced with New Coke. This was seen as the solution to take back the market share that had been lost to Pepsi. \n\nBut as it turns out, New Coke was a massive flop and the company ended up losing tens of millions of dollars. How could this have happened with data that seemed correct? It is because the data wasn‚Äôt complete, which made it inaccurate. The data didn't consider how customers would feel about New Coke replacing classic Coke. The company‚Äôs decision to retire classic Coke was a data-driven decision based on incomplete data.\n\nMars orbiter loss\nIn 1999, NASA lost the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter, even though it had good data. The spacecraft burned to pieces because of poor collaboration and communication. The Orbiter‚Äôs navigation team was using the SI or metric system (newtons) for their force calculations, but the engineers who built the spacecraft used the English Engineering Units system (pounds) for force calculations. \n\nNo one realized a problem even existed until the Orbiter burst into flames in the Martian atmosphere. Later, a NASA review board investigating the root cause of the problem figured out that the issue was isolated to the software that controlled the thrusters. One program calculated the thrusters‚Äô force in pounds; another program looking at the data assumed it was in newtons. The software controllers were making data-driven decisions to adjust the thrust based on 100% accurate data, but these decisions were wrong because of inaccurate assumptions when interpreting it. A conversion of the data from one system of measurement to the other could have prevented the loss.\n\nThis illustration shows a file icon with a checkmark to the right.\nWhen data is used strategically, businesses can transform and grow their revenue. Consider the examples below.\n\nCrate and Barrel\nAt Crate and Barrel, online sales jumped more than 40% during stay-at-home orders to combat the global pandemic. Currently, online sales make up more than 65% of their overall business. They are using data insights to accelerate their digital transformation and bring the best of online and offline experiences together for customers.\n\nBigQuery enables Crate and Barrel to \"draw on ten times [as many] information sources (compared to a few years ago) which are then analyzed and transformed into actionable insights that can be used to influence the customer‚Äôs next interaction. And this, in turn, drives revenue.\"\n\nRead more about Crate and Barrel's data strategy in How one retailer‚Äôs data strategy powers seamless customer experiences.\n\nPepsiCo \nSince the days of the New Coke launch, things have changed dramatically for beverage and other consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies. \n\nPepsiCo \"hired analytical talent and established cross-functional workflows around an infrastructure designed to put consumers‚Äô needs first. Then [they] set up the right processes to make critical decisions based on data and technology use cases. Finally, [they] invested in the right technology stack and platforms so that data could flow into a central cloud-based hub. This is critical. When data comes together, [they] develop a holistic understanding of the consumer and their journeys.\"\n\nRead about how PepsiCo is delivering a more personal and valuable experience to customers using data in How one of the world‚Äôs biggest marketers ripped up its playbook and learned to anticipate intent.\n\nKey skills for triumphant results\nAs a data analyst, your own skills and knowledge will be the most important part of any analysis project. It is important for you to keep a data-driven mindset, ask lots of questions, experiment with many different possibilities, and use both logic and creativity along the way. You will then be prepared to interpret your data with the highest levels of care and accuracy. Note that there is a difference between making a decision with incomplete data and making a decision with a small amount of data. You learned that making a decision with incomplete data is dangerous. But sometimes accurate data from a small test can help you make a good decision. Stay tuned. You will learn about how much data to collect later in the program.\n\n\n[Data](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/foundations/data.md)","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.228045327Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/ask/decision-making-types":{"title":"Decision-making types","content":"- [Data-driven decision-making](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/foundations/data-driven-decision-making.md)\n- Data-inspired decision making\n\t- Explores different data sources to find out what they have in common\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.228045327Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/ask/mathematical-thinking":{"title":"Mathematical thinking","content":"\nLinked to:\n- [Small data](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/ask/small-data.md)\n- [Big data](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/ask/big-data.md)","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.228045327Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/ask/metric":{"title":"Metric","content":"A metric is a single, quantifiable type of [Data](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/foundations/data.md) that can be used for measurement. \n\nCan be combined into [Formula](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/foundations/formula.md).\n\n# Metric goal\nA measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.228045327Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/ask/pivot-table":{"title":"Pivot table","content":"A [Data](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/foundations/data.md) summarization tool that is used in the data processing. \nPivot tables are used to summarize, sort, reorganize, group, count, total or average data stored in [Database](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/foundations/database.md).

For example, a conceptual data model may be used to define the business requirements for a new database. A conceptual data model doesn't contain technical details. \n\nLogical data modeling focuses on the technical details of a database such as relationships, attributes, and entities. For example, a logical data model defines how individual records are uniquely identified in a database. But it doesn't spell out actual names of database tables. That's the job of a physical data model.\n\nPhysical data modeling depicts how a database operates. A physical data model defines all entities and attributes used; for example, it includes table names, column names, and data types for the database.\n\nTechniques:\n- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)\n- Unified Modeling Language (UML)\n\nRefs:\n- [Data](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/foundations/data.md)","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.228045327Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/prepare/data-privacy":{"title":"Data privacy","content":"\nPreserving a data subject's information and activity any time a data transaction occurs. \n\nPersonal rights:\n- protection from unauthorized access to our private data, \n- freedom from inappropriate use of our data, \n- the right to inspect, update, or correct our data, \n- ability to give consent to use our data, \n- legal right to access our data. \n\nData privacy deals with the proper handling of data.

This can be tricky-- we want to keep our data safe and secure, but we also want to use it as soon as possible so that we can make meaningful and timely observations.\n\n# Encryption \nEncryption uses a unique algorithm to alter data and make it unusable by users and applications that don‚Äôt know the algorithm. This algorithm is saved as a ‚Äúkey‚Äù which can be used to reverse the encryption; so if you have the key, you can still use the data in its original form.  \n\n# Tokenization\nTokenization replaces the data elements you want to protect with randomly generated data referred to as a ‚Äútoken.‚Äù The original data is stored in a separate location and mapped to the tokens. To access the complete original data, the user or application needs to have permission to use the tokenized data and the token mapping.

Not only will this give you a treasure trove of useful information on a regular basis, but you will also learn the names of data science experts who you can follow, or possibly even connect with if you have good reason to.¬†\n    \n-   **Hackathons** (competitions) like those sponsored by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ \"This link takes you to the Kaggle home page.\"), one of the largest data science and machine learning communities in the world. Participating in a hackathon might not be for everyone. But after joining a community, you typically have access to forums where you can chat and connect with other data analysts.¬†\n    \n-   **Meetups**, or online meetings that are usually local to your geography. Enter a search for ‚Äòdata science meetups near me‚Äô to see what results you get. There is usually a posted schedule for upcoming meetings so you can attend virtually to meet other data analysts. Find out more information about [meetups happening around the world](https://www.meetup.com/topics/data-analytics/ \"This link takes you to the worldwide Data Analytics Meetup page.\").¬†\n    \n-   **Platforms** like LinkedIn and Twitter. Use a search on either platform to find data science or data analysis hashtags to follow. You can also post your own questions or articles to generate responses and build connections that way. At the time of this writing, the LinkedIn #dataanalyst hashtag had 11,842 followers, the #dataanalytics hashtag had 98,412 followers, and the #datascience hashtag had 746,945 followers. Many of the same hashtags work on Twitter and even on Instagram.\n    \n-   **Webinars** may showcase a panel of speakers and are usually recorded for convenient access and playback. You can see who is on a webinar panel and follow them too. Plus, a lot of webinars are free. One interesting pick is the [Tableau on Tableau webinar series](https://www.tableau.com/learn/series/how-we-do-data \"This link takes you to Tableau's on-demand webinars about how they use Tableau themselves.\"). Find out how Tableau has used Tableau in its internal departments.¬†\n    \n\n## In-person (offline) gatherings\n\n![Image of a group of people smiling and hanging out](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/WGFXd-skTlehV3frJK5XAw_3f906ec02799423c92323f2085492fe5_Screen-Shot-2021-03-04-at-11.25.20-PM.png?expiry=1671580800000\u0026hmac=N5ZcYEJnfj7ZjjvlYj9kW0qe9iFWjeo0GhuFDIT1ogw)\n\nIn-person gatherings are super valuable in a digitized world. They are a great way to meet people. A lot of online relationships start from in-person gatherings and are carried on after people return home. Many organizations that sponsor annual gatherings also offer virtual meetings and resources during the rest of the year.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to find in-person gatherings in your area:\n\n-   **Conferences** usually present innovative ideas and topics. The cost of conferences vary, and some are pricey. But lots of conferences offer discounts to students and some conferences like [Women in Analytics](https://womeninanalytics.com/about/ \"This link takes you to the Women in Analytics home page.\") aim to increase the number of under-represented groups in the field. Leading research and advisory companies such as [Gartner](https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/common/conference-calendar/gartner-conference-calendar.pdf \"This link takes you to the Gartner conferences page.\") also sponsor conferences for data and analytics. The [KDNuggets list of meetings and online events](https://www.kdnuggets.com/meetings/index.html \"This link takes you to the KDNuggets list of meetings and online events for data analytics.\") for AI, analytics, big data, data science, and machine learning is useful.\n    \n\n-   **Associations** or **societies** gather members to promote a field like data science. The [Digital Analytics Association](https://www.digitalanalyticsassociation.org/ \"This link takes you to the Digital Analytics Association home page.\"). The [KDNuggets list of societies and groups](https://www.kdnuggets.com/websites/societies.html \"This link takes you to a KDNuggets list of data analytics societies and groups.\") for analytics, data mining, data science, and knowledge discovery is useful.\n    \n\n-   **User communities** and **summits** offer events for users of data analysis tools; this is a chance to learn from the best. Have you seen the [Tableau community](https://community.tableau.com/s/ \"This link takes you to the Tableau online community.\")?\n    \n\n-   **Non-profit organizations** that promote the ethical use of data science and might offer events for the professional advancement of their members. The [Data Science Association](https://www.datascienceassn.org/ \"This link takes you to the Data Science Association's home page.\") is one example.","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.228045327Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/prepare/nominal-data":{"title":"Nominal data","content":"A type of qualitative [Data

statistics. As sample size increases, the results more closely resemble the normal (bell-shaped) distribution from a large number of samples. A sample of 30 is the smallest sample size for which the CLT is still valid.

This difference is called the margin of error. \n\nThe smaller the margin of error, the closer the results of the sample are to what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population.\n\n## Margin of error in marketing\n\nThe margin of error is also important in marketing. Let‚Äôs use A/B testing as an example. \nA/B testing (or split testing) tests two variations of the same web page to determine which page is more successful in attracting user traffic and generating revenue. User traffic that gets monetized is known as the conversion rate. A/B testing allows marketers to test emails, ads, and landing pages to find the data behind what is working and what isn‚Äôt working. Marketers use the **confidence interval** (determined by the conversion rate and the margin of error) to understand the results.¬†\n\nFor example, suppose you are conducting an A/B test to compare the effectiveness of two different email subject lines to entice people to open the email. You find that subject line A: ‚ÄúSpecial offer just for you‚Äù resulted in a 5% open rate compared to subject line B: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt miss this opportunity‚Äù at 3%.¬†\n\nDoes that mean subject line A is better than subject line B?¬†It depends on your margin of error. If the margin of error was 2%, then subject line A‚Äôs actual open rate or confidence interval is somewhere between 3% and 7%. Since the lower end of the interval overlaps with subject line B‚Äôs results at 3%, you can‚Äôt conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between subject line A and B. Examining the margin of error is important when making conclusions based on your test results.","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.228045327Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/process":{"title":"Process","content":"- [Alignment with business objective](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/alignment-with-business-objective.md)\n- [Clean data](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/clean-data.md)\n- [Confidence level](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/confidence-level.md)\n- [Confidence level](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/confidence-level.md)\n- [Consent](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/consent.md)\n- [Data engineers](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/data-engineers.md)\n- [Data integrity](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/data-integrity.md)\n- [Data manipulation](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/data-manipulation.md)\n- [Data merging](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/data-merging.md)\n- [Data replication](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/data-replication.md)\n- [Data transfer](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/data-transfer.md)\n- [Data validation](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/data-validation.md)\n- [Data warehousing specialists](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/data-warehousing-specialists.md)\n- [Dirty data](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/dirty-data.md)\n- [Hypothesis testing](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/hypothesis-testing.md)\n- [Insufficient data](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/insufficient-data.md)\n- [Margin error](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/margin-error.md)\n- [Random sampling](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/random-sampling.md)\n- [Statistical power](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/statistical-power.md)\n- [Statistical significance](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/statistical-significance.md)","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.228045327Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/random-sampling":{"title":"Random sampling","content":"It is a way of selecting a [Sample](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/prepare/sample.md) from a [Population](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/prepare/population.md) so that every possible type of the sample has an equal chance of being chosen.","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.228045327Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/statistical-power":{"title":"Statistical power","content":"The probability of getting meaningful results from a test.\n\nGenerally, you need a statistical power of at least 0.8 (80%) to consider your results statistically significant ([Statistical significance](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/statistical-significance.md))","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.228045327Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/process/statistical-significance":{"title":"Statistical significance","content":"The determination of whether your result could be due to random chance or not. \nThe greater the significance, the less due to chance.\n\nIf a test is statistically significant, it means the results of the test are real and not an error caused by random change.

These design principles are important to your work as a data analyst because they help you make sure that you are creating visualizations that communicate your data effectively to your audience. By keeping these rules in mind, you can plan and evaluate your data visualizations to decide if they are working for you and your goals. And, if they aren‚Äôt, you can adjust them! \n\nPrinciple\n\nDescription\n\nChoose the right visual\n\nOne of the first things you have to decide is which visual will be the most effective for your audience. Sometimes, a simple table is the best visualization. Other times, you need a more complex visualization to illustrate your point. \n\nOptimize the data-ink ratio\n\nThe data-ink entails focusing on the part of the visual that is essential to understanding the point of the chart. Try to minimize non-data ink like boxes around legends or shadows to optimize the data-ink ratio.\n\nUse orientation effectively\n\nMake sure the written components of the visual, like the labels on a bar chart, are easy to read. You can change the orientation of your visual to make it easier to read and understand. \n\nColor\n\nThere are a lot of important considerations when thinking about using color in your visuals. These include using color consciously and meaningfully, staying consistent throughout your visuals, being considerate of what colors mean to different people, and using inclusive color scales that make sense for everyone viewing them.\n\nNumbers of things\n\nThink about how many elements you include in any visual. If your visualization uses lines, try to plot five or fewer. If that isn‚Äôt possible, use color or hue to emphasize important lines. Also, when using visuals like pie charts, try to keep the number of segments to less than seven since too many elements can be distracting. \n\n# Balance\nThe design principle of creating aesthetic appeal and clarity in a data visualization by\nevenly distributing visual elements\n# Emphasis\nThe design principle of arranging visual elements to focus the audience‚Äôs attention\non important information in a data visualization\n# Pattern\nThe design principle of using similar visual elements to demonstrate trends and\nrelationships in a data visualization","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.232045606Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/share/design-thinking":{"title":"Design thinking","content":"A process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way. \n\n# Phases\nPhases:\n- Empathize\n\t- Think about the emotions and needs of the targeted audience\n- Define\n\t- It helps you find your audience's needs, their problems, and your insights. \n\t- Figuring out exactly what your audience needs from the data\n- Ideate\n\t- Start to generate your data viz ideas\n- Prototype\n\t- Development of the data viz ideas\n\t- Putting visualizations together for testing and feedback\n- Test\n\t- Piloting\n\t- Get feedback from a small pilot audience \n\t- Showing prototype visualizations to people before stakeholders see them\n\nNo strict order","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.232045606Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/data-analysts/share/dynamic-visualizations":{"title":"Dynamic visualizations","content":"Visualizations that are interactive or change over time.

Here are two frameworks that may be useful for you as you create your own data viz: \n\n1) The McCandless Method\n\nYou learned about the David McCandless method in the first lesson on effective data visualizations, but as a refresher, the McCandless Method lists four elements of good data visualization: \n- Information: the data you are working with\n- Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept\n- Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual\n- Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression\n\nNote: One useful way of approaching this framework is to notice the parts of the graphic where there is incomplete overlap between all four elements. For example, visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art. Data plus visual form without a goal or function is eye candy. Data with a goal but no story or visual form is boring. All four elements need to be at work to create an effective visual.\n\n2) Kaiser Fung‚Äôs Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup\n\nThis approach is a useful set of questions that can help consumers of data visualization critique what they are consuming and determine how effective it is. The Checkup has three questions:\n- What is the practical question? \n- What does the data say?\n- What does the visual say? \n\nNote: This checklist helps you think about your data viz from the perspective of your audience and decide if your visual is communicating your data effectively to them or not. In addition to these frameworks, there are some other building blocks that can help you construct your data visualizations. \n\nPre-attentive attributes: marks and channels\nCreating effective visuals means leveraging what we know about how the brain works, and then using specific visual elements to communicate the information effectively. Pre-attentive attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort. The essential, basic building blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels. \n\nMarks\nMarks are basic visual objects like points, lines, and shapes. Every mark can be broken down into four qualities: \n\nPosition - Where a specific mark is in space in relation to a scale or to other marks\n\nsimple line chart with two lines. One is red and one is blue, and there is obvious space between them.\n2. Size - How big, small, long, or tall a mark is\n\na plot with points that are different sizes\n3. Shape - Whether a specific object is given a shape that communicates something about it\n\nhorizontal bar chart, but bars are made of icons shaped like people\n4. Color - What color the mark is\n\na bar chart with a red, green, yellow, grey, and blue bar\nChannels\nChannels are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data. Channels are basically marks that have been used to visualize data. Channels will vary in terms of how effective they are at communicating data based on three elements: \n\n1. Accuracy - Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented? \n\nFor example, color is very accurate when communicating categorical differences, like apples and oranges. But it is much less effective when distinguishing quantitative data like 5 from 5.5.\n\na plot with apples and oranges representing the data points\n2. Popout - How easy is it to distinguish certain values from others? \n\nThere are many ways of drawing attention to specific parts of a visual, and many of them leverage pre-attentive attributes like line length, size, line width, shape, enclosure, hue, and intensity.\n\na line chart with three blue lines and one red line\n3. Grouping - How good is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data? \n\nConsider the proximity, similarity, enclosure, connectedness, and continuity of the channel.\n\n bar chart with four groups of bars. In each group, there is a red bar and a blue bar\nBut, remember: the more you emphasize different things, the less that emphasis counts. The more you emphasize one single thing, the more that counts.

It is important to note that Spotify‚Äôs model is not a true Agile framework. There is no standard guide on how to implement it. The model began as a description of how Spotify overcame the challenges of scaling Agile. By focusing their efforts on culture, team autonomy, communication, accountability, and quality, they increased their agility over time. Spotify‚Äôs approach has had a huge impact on workflows and team structures across the tech world. \n\nSome of the key components include:\n- Squads: Like Scrum teams, Squads are autonomous teams of 6‚Äì12 people working toward the same outcome. All Squads include a coach (similar to a Scrum Master) and a Product Owner.\n- Tribes: When multiple Squads work on the same feature area, they form a Tribe of 40‚Äì150 people. Each Tribe has a Tribe Lead who fosters collaboration and coordination.\n- Chapters: Squads may be autonomous, but specialists (e.g., JavaScript developers) should still align across an organization. Chapters establish best practices and, where necessary, set standards. \n- Guilds: Any group of people interested in a certain topic can form a Guild, where people with shared interests can come together as a community. \n\nWhile some organizations have had success with this model, be aware that it evolved from Spotify‚Äôs already significant Agile experience. It is the product of extensive introspection and adaptation and draws heavily on the company‚Äôs culture of trust, transparency, and autonomy. Therefore, the value of Spotify‚Äôs approach to scaling is not in team names like Squads and Tribes but in how they developed practices that supported and served their organizational culture. \n\nLinks:\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GK1NDTWbkY\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.232045606Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/vuca":{"title":"VUCA","content":"VUCA is an acronym that defines the conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world.\n\n- Volatility\n- Uncertainty\n- Complexity\n- Ambiguity\n\n# Volatility\n- Volatility refers to the rate of change and churns in a business or situation\n# Uncertainty\n- Uncertainty refers to the lack of¬†predictability or high potential for surprise.\n# Complexity\n- Complexity refers to¬†the high number of interrelated forces,¬†issues, organizations,¬†and factors that would influence the project.\n# Ambiguity\n- Ambiguity refers to the possibility of misunderstanding¬†the conditions and root causes¬†of events or circumstances.\n\n- Developed as a way to deal with these forces in a changing and uncertain world\n- Businesses can apply the concept of VUCA as a tool for determining how best to approach projects. \n\n# Applying Agile in a VUCA environment\n\n- When starting on a new project, it's helpful to examine the environment and conditions in which the project exists before deciding the best approach to use\n- If your project has a high level of VUCA parameters, it's a good sign you should consider an [Agile](danielesalvatore/.trash/agile.md) approach\n- An [Agile](danielesalvatore/.trash/agile.md) approach will lead to better outcomes by giving you and your team tools and systems to mitigate VUCA risks.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.232045606Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/work-in-progress":{"title":"Work in Progress","content":"Work in progress \n\n# Limit\n[Tasks](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/tasks.md) are limited to what the team can actually handle during a certain amount of time.

Conger's steps to effective influencing.\n- Establish credibility\n- Frame for common ground\n- Provide evidence\n- Connect emotionally\n\n# Establish credibility\nMake the case for why your audience should listen to you.\n\nWhen trying to persuade another person to listen to you, it helps to establish credibility. Ask yourself, why should this person listen to you? According to Conger, it is best to draw credibility from both expertise and relationships.¬†\n\nYou can build credibility by showing a level of expertise on the topic at hand. It also helps to have ‚Äúa history of sound judgment.‚Äù If you find that you lack expertise on a subject, don‚Äôt worry! You can work to increase your knowledge through education or research, or you can even ask an expert for help.\n\nYou can also build credibility through strong relationships with your audience and others around you. Conger found that influential leaders tend to show their trustworthiness and willingness to do right by their colleagues over time, and in turn, people are more likely to listen to them.\n\n## Source of credibility\n- Expertise\n- Relationships\n\n# Frame for common ground\nMake the case for how your idea can benefit your audience.\n\nThe next step in effectively persuading people is to frame for common ground. You can do this by making a case for how your idea would benefit your audience, and you can determine how your ideas will benefit your audience by gaining a strong understanding of them and what they value. Pay close attention to what matters to your audience by listening carefully and gathering information during meetings and conversations. Then they frame your ideas based on your audience‚Äôs needs and interests.¬†\n\n# Provide evidence\nMake your case through hard data and persuasive [Storytelling](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/share/data-visualization/storytelling.md).\n\nThe third step is to provide evidence that supports your ideas. As Conger notes, though numbers are important, the best persuaders pair numbers with vivid language**.** They share stories, examples, and metaphors to help influence their audiences. Using vivid language can help bring your figures to life and draw stakeholders‚Äô interest to your proposal.\n\n# Connect emotionally\nDemonstrate to your audience that you're emotionally committed to your idea. \nThe fourth step is to connect emotionally with your audience. In this step, you illustrate that you are emotionally invested in the idea that you are presenting. But crucially, Conger notes, you must also do your best to determine and match the emotional state of your audience.\n\n## Example \n_I‚Äôd like to propose a new onboarding process for graphic design hires._¬†\n\n**(Provide evidence)** _In reviewing our new hire surveys, 80% of recent graphic design hires have assigned a negative rating to our onboarding process. When I followed up¬† with respondents, I learned that our graphic designers lack access to relevant information that could help them acclimate to our organization faster. To address this issue, I would like to create a digital welcome packet containing design-specific onboarding documentation._\n\n**(Frame for common ground)** _I have met with leaders on the graphic design team to discuss this idea, and they agreed that a design-specific onboarding process might help increase the productivity of new hires, since a better onboarding process would enable them to be better prepared to take on projects in their first few weeks on the job._\n\n**(Establish credibility)** _In my previous role, I designed a similar, role-specific onboarding process, which increased our new hire satisfaction rates by 60%. I think a new process could benefit employees here, as well._\n\n**(Connect emotionally)** _It can be overwhelming to join a new company. A smoother, more personalized onboarding experience might help set the tone for the kind of support new graphic design hires can expect from our team._¬†\n\n## **Key takeaway**\n\nIn this influencing statement, the project manager:\n-   **Provided evidence** from company surveys to set the stage for her proposal.\n-   **Framed for common ground** by noting how a new onboarding process might increase employee productivity.\n-   **Established credibility** by outlining her previous experience with launching similar processes.\n-   **Connected emotionally** by encouraging her audience to reflect on past experiences they may have endured as a new hire.¬†","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.236045885Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/project-management/project-execution/effective-teams/team-development":{"title":"Team development","content":"Bruce Truckman's stage of [Team](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/team.md) development:\n- Forming\n- Storming\n- Norming\n- Performing\n- Adjourning\n\n## Forming\n- Team gets to know one another\n- [Project manager](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md) should clarify the project goals, roles, and context of the project\n- Done during the [Make a plan](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project/life-cycle/make-a-plan.md) project phase. \n## Storming\n- As people settle into their roles and the work on their project begins, the people on your team are interacting more and maybe disagreeing a bit.

They are generally for assets that the company will own and keep. The company incurs these expenses because they believe they will create a benefit for the company in the future. \n\n# OPEX\nOPEX (operating expenses) are the short-term expenses that are required for the day-to-day tasks involved in running the company, such as wages, rent, and utilities. They are often recurring.  \n\nYou may need to account for both OPEX and CAPEX on your projects. For example, a major software acquisition as part of an IT project could be treated by your organization as a capital expense. The monthly wages paid to a contractor to help deploy the software would be an operating expense.

This isn‚Äôt very effective, though. It is best to strive for open lines of communication, where each party shares their worries and preferences. For instance, if your team‚Äôs last supplier provided you with low quality products, you might voice this as a concern so your expectations around quality are clear. \n\n### Ask questions and listen actively to responses. \nJust like you shared your concerns and expectations, you can ask the other party questions to clarify what their concerns and expectations are. That way, both parties will have shared all the necessary information to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. \n\n### Propose multiple options whenever possible. \nIn negotiations, presenting only one option or solution can set you up for failure because the other person might think your first offer is the only one. If the other party rejects all of your proposals, ask them to communicate which one they like best, as that may point you in the direction of finding a solution that works for everyone.\n\n# Tips for navigating scope with stakeholders\n## Understand motivations. \nBefore your discussion, consider each stakeholder's motivations for wanting to adjust the project‚Äôs scope. Some of those motivations are budgetary (such as wanting to reduce the project‚Äôs costs), some are interpersonal (such as wanting more time to complete tasks), and some are related to personal career goals (such as maintaining their current position or striving for a promotion). Understanding your stakeholders‚Äô motivations can help you work together to find a compromise. \n\n## Set the scene. \nStart the discussion with a reflection on why you are meeting. Remind your stakeholders why you are engaged in this project, and assure them that you all share a common goal.\n\n## Listen first. \nHear what your stakeholders have to say before you present your views. This will demonstrate your desire to understand the other party‚Äôs perspective. Acknowledging their point of view may make it easier for them to accept your suggestions or solutions when their ideas or opinions differ from yours.\n\n## Ask questions to define goals. \nBe thorough and ask as many questions as you feel necessary to understand what the stakeholder wants. This might include getting them to define their customer or business goals. Strive for getting specific, measurable details from your stakeholders, so that later, you‚Äôll be able to determine whether you‚Äôve successfully met their goals. Eliciting language that is measurable (rather than subjective or unclear) will help you define goals. An example of a specific, measurable goal could be: ‚ÄúWe want to cut the amount of time it takes customers to sign up for our newsletter by at least 30 percent.‚Äù\n\n## Explain the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù before the ‚Äúwhat.‚Äù \nWhen attempting to persuade stakeholders‚Äîor anyone, for that matter‚Äîto see things your way, explain the reasons for your request before describing what you want. For instance, start by explaining the value that could be added to your company or project by defining scope in a certain way. If stakeholders understand where you‚Äôre coming from first, they‚Äôre more likely to grant your request when you ask for it.\n\n## Do not oversell. \nSometimes it‚Äôs best to state your case and give others some time to respond. After you have presented your reasons, position, and request, withdraw slightly to give your audience time to process what you have said. Think of your silence, in this situation, as a sign of respect for your stakeholders; it shows them you want to hear from them. And, if they are quiet for a while, it means that you have stimulated thought.  \n\n## Be creative. \nWorking to find alternative solutions can quickly turn a heavy negotiation into an inspiring team effort. To find real solutions to negotiation stalemates, think creatively about all the aspects of the project. You may find that there is more than one solution to differing opinions. \n\n## Do not make it personal. \nAlways focus on what is good for the project. If personal considerations enter into the discussion, reframe the conversation by bringing up objective facts.\n\n## Seek a win-win outcome. \nFinally, consider what it will take for the other side to be satisfied. Then, try to identify a way to ensure you are satisfied as well. There will be times when one party may have to compromise more than the other,  but a mutually beneficial agreement (an agreement that benefits all parties involved) should always be the goal. The next reading will cover strategies for achieving mutually beneficial agreements with stakeholders. \n","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.240046164Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/okr":{"title":"OKR","content":"OKR: Objectives and Key Results\nOKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. \n\t- [Project goals](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project-goals.md)\n\t- [Project metrics](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-execution/project-data/project-metrics.md)\n\t\nObjective:\n- Defines what needs to be achieved\n- Describes the desired outcome\n\nKey Results:\n- The measurable outcome that defines when the objective has been met\n\nOKR levels:\n- Company-level\n    - Shared across an organization so that everyone can align and focus their effort to help the company reach its goals\n- Department-level\n- Project-level\n    - Help define measurable project goals.

You may face ethical traps throughout the course of a project. However, ethics can be of particular concern when it comes to procurement. As you have learned, project managers must take precautions to ensure that they and their suppliers are following ethical principles during the procurement process. \n\n# Common ethical traps\nSometimes, potential ethical issues can be overlooked or can be considered the necessary cost of doing business. This is a dangerous line of thinking since these types of assumptions can put your project, company, and career at risk. To review what we discussed in the video, a few of the most common ethical traps that exist when conducting procurements are corruption and bribery, sole-supplier sourcing, and interactions with state-owned agencies.\n\n## Corruption and bribery   \nYou may be confronted with different types of corruption when going through the procurement process. One form of corruption is when a vendor seeks to reduce the competition for a contract during the bidding process. A company may attempt to bribe members within the organization to sway their decision into a favorable outcome for the vendor. Bribes may include things like money, gifts, tickets to events, and more. Another type of corruption scheme is to offer a certain percentage of an awarded contract‚Äîalso known as a kickback‚Äîto an official who can ensure that their company wins the bid.\n\n## Sole-supplier sourcing   \nIn some situations, having a vendor who a company is already familiar with smooths the procurement process and works well for both parties. Ethical issues arise when other vendors aren‚Äôt even allowed to bid for contracts for which they are similarly qualified. With sole-supplier sourcing, vendors may reach out to buyers before a bid is even requested. When the buyer‚Äôs organization decides to work with that vendor based on their previously-established relationship, that limits competition before the bidding has even begun. When this happens, companies and the public miss out on the advantages of competition, such as reasonable pricing, product quality standards, or speedy delivery options. \n\n## Interactions with state-owned entities\nThere are some instances in which government agencies require an organization to adhere to stricter ethical standards than they might have otherwise. Most government regulatory agencies exist because a company or an entire industry has ranked profits over their workers or the environment. Governmental agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, for example, keep businesses within legal and ethical standards. If you are unfamiliar with any governmental restrictions that may affect your industry, organization, or project, you could unintentionally fall into an ethical trap.\n\n# Avoiding ethical traps   \nHere are some guidelines that will help you avoid falling into ethical traps when it comes to procurement:\n\n## Understand the legal requirements for your procurements. \nEvery country has regulations to adhere to when conducting business in that country. Be sure to research the legal and ethical requirements based on your project and procurement needs, and if your organization has a legal team, make sure to lean on them for support and advice.\n\n## Stick to your ethical codes. \nHonesty, responsibility, respect, and fairness are the values that underpin ethical behavior in the project management profession. The Project Management Institute‚Äôs (PMI) code of ethics provides detailed guidelines to help ensure you maintain ethical conduct in your projects. \n\n## Test your ethics. \nWhen you face an ethical dilemma, ask yourself questions in each of the following categories:\n- Shame: Would you be ashamed if someone knew what you did?\n- Community: Would you want your friends to know the decision you made? \n- Legal: Would you face legal action if you took this action? \n- Situation: Would your actions be justified in this situation?\n- Consequence: Would a negative outcome be worth your actions?

The project manager works with their team to ensure that all tasks are captured.\n- Bottom-up scheduling: In this approach, the project manager looks at all of the individual tasks that need to be completed and then rolls those tasks into manageable chunks that lead to a milestone. \n\n![milestones-and-tasks.png](None)\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-06T08:09:04.240046164Z","tags":[]},"/danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/project-plan/project-plan":{"title":"Project plan","content":"A living document that includes the scope, milestones, and any project activity. \n\nThe [Project schedule](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/project-plan/project-schedule.md) estimates the time it'll take to complete the project. \n\nA project plan will the following elements:\n- [Tasks](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/tasks.md)\n- [Milestones](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/milestones.md)\n- People and team roles\n- Documentation\n\t- like [RACI chart](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/raci-chart.md), [Project charter](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/project-charter.md), and [Budget](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/budget/budget.md)\n- Time estimated to complete the project\n\nSections of a project plan:\n- Project scope and goals, \n- the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), \n- the Budget, \n- and Management plans \n\n# Differences between project plan vs. project schedule\n- A project plan is an extensive document that includes project risks, budget, organization, scope, goals, objectives, and also project schedule.
