Coordination among teams is critical to ensuring the deliverables from each team can be integrated into one larger, cohesive deliverable. \n\nScrum of Scrums involves the following elements:\n\n- A group of at least 12 or more people divided into Scrum Teams of five to ten people each \n- Scrum of Scrums meetings, which are held once a week, twice a week, or daily. These meetings follow the same format as a Daily Scrum meeting but focus on the Scrum team. In these meetings, you‚Äôll discuss questions like: ‚ÄúWhat did the team do yesterday? What problems occurred, if any, that are negatively affecting your team? What does your team want to accomplish before we meet again? Is your team blocked from moving forward on any tasks?‚Äù\n- A Scrum Master or designated ‚Äúambassador‚Äù for each team that participates in the Scrum of Scrums meetings and a Scrum of Scrums Master who focuses on the overall Scrum process across multiple teams \n- Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective meetings \n\nBeyond these very basic guidelines, there is no official framework or methodology to implement Scrum of Scrums. Scrum of Scrums assumes that teams have a good working understanding of Scrum and are able to apply the scaling principles to how they work. Building on this knowledge, they design and iterate their own approach to coordinate multiple teams working on the same product. \n\n\nLinks:\n- https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-of-scrums","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.647920841Z","tags":null},"/agile-project-management/scrum/acceptance-criteria":{"title":"Acceptance criteria","content":"The checklist you will use to decide whether the [User stories](agile-project-management/scrum/user-stories.md) are done. \n\nLink:\n- [Definition of done](agile-project-management/scrum/definition-of-done.md)","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.647920841Z","tags":null},"/agile-project-management/scrum/daily-stand-up":{"title":"Daily Stand-up","content":"This is where the team meets for 15 minutes or less every day of the [Sprint](agile-project-management/scrum/sprint.md) to inspect their progress toward their goal.\n\nTime for the Team to sync, replying to the following questions:\n- What did I do yesterday?\n- What will I do today?\n- Did I notice any blockers?","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.647920841Z","tags":null},"/agile-project-management/scrum/definition-of-done":{"title":"Definition of done","content":"Definition of Done refers to an agreed-upon set of items that must be completed before our user story or Backlog item can be considered complete.\n\nDefined by the Team","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.647920841Z","tags":null},"/agile-project-management/scrum/development-team-or-developers":{"title":"Development team (or Developers)","content":"The people who do the work to build the product.

It is important to note that Spotify‚Äôs model is not a true Agile framework. There is no standard guide on how to implement it. The model began as a description of how Spotify overcame the challenges of scaling Agile. By focusing their efforts on culture, team autonomy, communication, accountability, and quality, they increased their agility over time. Spotify‚Äôs approach has had a huge impact on workflows and team structures across the tech world. \n\nSome of the key components include:\n- Squads: Like Scrum teams, Squads are autonomous teams of 6‚Äì12 people working toward the same outcome. All Squads include a coach (similar to a Scrum Master) and a Product Owner.\n- Tribes: When multiple Squads work on the same feature area, they form a Tribe of 40‚Äì150 people. Each Tribe has a Tribe Lead who fosters collaboration and coordination.\n- Chapters: Squads may be autonomous, but specialists (e.g., JavaScript developers) should still align across an organization. Chapters establish best practices and, where necessary, set standards. \n- Guilds: Any group of people interested in a certain topic can form a Guild, where people with shared interests can come together as a community. \n\nWhile some organizations have had success with this model, be aware that it evolved from Spotify‚Äôs already significant Agile experience. It is the product of extensive introspection and adaptation and draws heavily on the company‚Äôs culture of trust, transparency, and autonomy. Therefore, the value of Spotify‚Äôs approach to scaling is not in team names like Squads and Tribes but in how they developed practices that supported and served their organizational culture. \n\nLinks:\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GK1NDTWbkY\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.647920841Z","tags":null},"/agile-project-management/vuca":{"title":"VUCA","content":"VUCA is an acronym that defines the conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world.\n\n- Volatility\n- Uncertainty\n- Complexity\n- Ambiguity\n\n# Volatility\n- Volatility refers to the rate of change and churns in a business or situation\n# Uncertainty\n- Uncertainty refers to the lack of¬†predictability or high potential for surprise.\n# Complexity\n- Complexity refers to¬†the high number of interrelated forces,¬†issues, organizations,¬†and factors that would influence the project.\n# Ambiguity\n- Ambiguity refers to the possibility of misunderstanding¬†the conditions and root causes¬†of events or circumstances.\n\n- Developed as a way to deal with these forces in a changing and uncertain world\n- Businesses can apply the concept of VUCA as a tool for determining how best to approach projects. \n\n# Applying Agile in a VUCA environment\n\n- When starting on a new project, it's helpful to examine the environment and conditions in which the project exists before deciding the best approach to use\n- If your project has a high level of VUCA parameters, it's a good sign you should consider an [Agile](agile-project-management/agile.md) approach\n- An [Agile](agile-project-management/agile.md) approach will lead to better outcomes by giving you and your team tools and systems to mitigate VUCA risks.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.647920841Z","tags":null},"/agile-project-management/work-in-progress":{"title":"Work in Progress","content":"Work in progress \n\n# Limit\n[Tasks](project-planning/tasks.md) are limited to what the team can actually handle during a certain amount of time.

Conger's steps to effective influencing.\n- Establish credibility\n- Frame for common ground\n- Provide evidence\n- Connect emotionally\n\n# Establish credibility\nMake the case for why your audience should listen to you.\n\nWhen trying to persuade another person to listen to you, it helps to establish credibility. Ask yourself, why should this person listen to you? According to Conger, it is best to draw credibility from both expertise and relationships.¬†\n\nYou can build credibility by showing a level of expertise on the topic at hand. It also helps to have ‚Äúa history of sound judgment.‚Äù If you find that you lack expertise on a subject, don‚Äôt worry! You can work to increase your knowledge through education or research, or you can even ask an expert for help.\n\nYou can also build credibility through strong relationships with your audience and others around you. Conger found that influential leaders tend to show their trustworthiness and willingness to do right by their colleagues over time, and in turn, people are more likely to listen to them.\n\n## Source of credibility\n- Expertise\n- Relationships\n\n# Frame for common ground\nMake the case for how your idea can benefit your audience.\n\nThe next step in effectively persuading people is to frame for common ground. You can do this by making a case for how your idea would benefit your audience, and you can determine how your ideas will benefit your audience by gaining a strong understanding of them and what they value. Pay close attention to what matters to your audience by listening carefully and gathering information during meetings and conversations. Then they frame your ideas based on your audience‚Äôs needs and interests.¬†\n\n# Provide evidence\nMake your case through hard data and persuasive [Storytelling](project-execution/data-visualization/storytelling.md).\n\nThe third step is to provide evidence that supports your ideas. As Conger notes, though numbers are important, the best persuaders pair numbers with vivid language**.** They share stories, examples, and metaphors to help influence their audiences. Using vivid language can help bring your figures to life and draw stakeholders‚Äô interest to your proposal.\n\n# Connect emotionally\nDemonstrate to your audience that you're emotionally committed to your idea. \nThe fourth step is to connect emotionally with your audience. In this step, you illustrate that you are emotionally invested in the idea that you are presenting. But crucially, Conger notes, you must also do your best to determine and match the emotional state of your audience.\n\n## Example \n_I‚Äôd like to propose a new onboarding process for graphic design hires._¬†\n\n**(Provide evidence)** _In reviewing our new hire surveys, 80% of recent graphic design hires have assigned a negative rating to our onboarding process. When I followed up¬† with respondents, I learned that our graphic designers lack access to relevant information that could help them acclimate to our organization faster. To address this issue, I would like to create a digital welcome packet containing design-specific onboarding documentation._\n\n**(Frame for common ground)** _I have met with leaders on the graphic design team to discuss this idea, and they agreed that a design-specific onboarding process might help increase the productivity of new hires, since a better onboarding process would enable them to be better prepared to take on projects in their first few weeks on the job._\n\n**(Establish credibility)** _In my previous role, I designed a similar, role-specific onboarding process, which increased our new hire satisfaction rates by 60%. I think a new process could benefit employees here, as well._\n\n**(Connect emotionally)** _It can be overwhelming to join a new company. A smoother, more personalized onboarding experience might help set the tone for the kind of support new graphic design hires can expect from our team._¬†\n\n## **Key takeaway**\n\nIn this influencing statement, the project manager:\n-   **Provided evidence** from company surveys to set the stage for her proposal.\n-   **Framed for common ground** by noting how a new onboarding process might increase employee productivity.\n-   **Established credibility** by outlining her previous experience with launching similar processes.\n-   **Connected emotionally** by encouraging her audience to reflect on past experiences they may have endured as a new hire.¬†","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.655920887Z","tags":null},"/project-execution/effective-teams/team-development":{"title":"Team development","content":"Bruce Truckman's stage of [Team](foundations-of-project-management/actors/team.md) development:\n- Forming\n- Storming\n- Norming\n- Performing\n- Adjourning\n\n## Forming\n- Team gets to know one another\n- [Project manager](foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md) should clarify the project goals, roles, and context of the project\n- Done during the [Make a plan](foundations-of-project-management/project/life-cycle/make-a-plan.md) project phase. \n## Storming\n- As people settle into their roles and the work on their project begins, the people on your team are interacting more and maybe disagreeing a bit.

This includes the purpose of data collection and processing, privacy preferences, the way organizations manage personal data and the rights of individuals. It focuses on making sure the ways we collect, process, share, archive, and delete data are all in accordance with the law.\n\n## Data bias\nMake sure that the data you collect does not indicate any biases. Data bias is a type of error that tends to skew results in a certain direction.\n\nType of bias:\n- Sampling bias is when a sample is not representative of the population as a whole. For example, maybe your sample did not include people above the age of 65. Or maybe you excluded people from certain socioeconomic groups.\n- Observer bias is the tendency for different people to observe things differently. For example, stakeholders from different parts of the world might view the same data differently and draw different conclusions from it. \n- Interpretation bias is the tendency to always interpret situations that don‚Äôt have obvious answers in a strictly positive or negative way, when, in fact there is more than one way to understand the data. Data that does not provide an obvious set of conclusions makes some people feel anxious, which can lead to interpretation bias. For example, a team member might interpret inconclusive survey results negatively, while other team members might be able to think more carefully and assess the data from different angles. \n- Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs. For example, you might ask only specific stakeholders for feedback on parts of your project because you know they are the most likely to have the same perspective as you.","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.659920909Z","tags":null},"/project-execution/project-data/duration":{"title":"Duration","content":"The total time it takes to complete the project from start to finish","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.659920909Z","tags":null},"/project-execution/project-data/important-data":{"title":"Important data","content":"Being aware of the different types of [Data](project-execution/project-data/data.md) you have access to and knowing which [Signal](project-execution/project-data/signal.md) to respond to are key to deciding what data is most important. \n\n- identify which tasks contribute most to the overall goal\n- Prioritize the data or metrics that are most valuable to stakeholders\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.659920909Z","tags":null},"/project-execution/project-data/pii-personally-identifiable-information":{"title":"PII (personally identifiable information)","content":"Information that could be used to directly identify, contact, or locate an individual","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.659920909Z","tags":null},"/project-execution/project-data/project-data":{"title":"Project data","content":"Topics:\n- [Data](project-execution/project-data/data.md)\n- [Data analysis](project-execution/project-data/data-analysis.md)\n- [Duration](project-execution/project-data/duration.md)\n- [Data ethics](project-execution/project-data/data-ethics.md)\n- [Duration](project-execution/project-data/duration.md)\n- [Important data](project-execution/project-data/important-data.md)\n- [PII (personally identifiable information)](project-execution/project-data/pii-personally-identifiable-information.md)\n- [Project data](project-execution/project-data/project-data.md)\n- [Project metrics](project-execution/project-data/project-metrics.md)\n- [Projections](project-execution/project-data/projections.md)\n- [Qualitative data](project-execution/project-data/qualitative-data.md)\n- [Quantitative data](project-execution/project-data/quantitative-data.md)\n- [Signal](project-execution/project-data/signal.md)\n- [Value of data](project-execution/project-data/value-of-data.md)","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.659920909Z","tags":null},"/project-execution/project-data/project-metrics":{"title":"Project metrics","content":"Metrics:\n- Productivity metrics\n- Quality metrics\n\n# Productivity metrics\n- They allow you to track the effectiveness and efficiency of your project\n\t- [Milestones](project-planning/milestones.md)\n\t- [Tasks](project-planning/tasks.md)\n\t- [Projections](project-execution/project-data/projections.md)\n\t- [Duration](project-execution/project-data/duration.md)\n# Quality metrics\n- Metrics that relate to achieving acceptable outcomes\n\t- Number of [Change](project-execution/change.md) (inconsistency from the initial requirements of the project)\n\t- [Issue](project-planning/risk-management/issue.md)\n\t- [Cost variance](project-initiation/budget/cost-variance.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.659920909Z","tags":null},"/project-execution/project-data/projections":{"title":"Projections","content":"\nHow you predict an outcome based on the information you have now.","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.659920909Z","tags":null},"/project-execution/project-data/qualitative-data":{"title":"Qualitative data","content":"Subjective qualities that can't be measured with numerical data.

These expenses can be organized into different categories. Two of the most common are CAPEX (capital expenses) and OPEX (operating expenses).\n\n# CAPEX\nCAPEX (capital expenses) are an organization's major, long-term, upfront expenses, such as buildings, equipment, and vehicles. They are generally for assets that the company will own and keep. The company incurs these expenses because they believe they will create a benefit for the company in the future. \n\n# OPEX\nOPEX (operating expenses) are the short-term expenses that are required for the day-to-day tasks involved in running the company, such as wages, rent, and utilities. They are often recurring.  \n\nYou may need to account for both OPEX and CAPEX on your projects. For example, a major software acquisition as part of an IT project could be treated by your organization as a capital expense. The monthly wages paid to a contractor to help deploy the software would be an operating expense. It‚Äôs a good idea to talk to your finance or accounting department when you start working on your project budget to see how they determine the difference between OPEX and CAPEX.

In some cases, a project may start out with all of the cash it will receive until the end.

This isn‚Äôt very effective, though. It is best to strive for open lines of communication, where each party shares their worries and preferences. For instance, if your team‚Äôs last supplier provided you with low quality products, you might voice this as a concern so your expectations around quality are clear. \n\n### Ask questions and listen actively to responses. \nJust like you shared your concerns and expectations, you can ask the other party questions to clarify what their concerns and expectations are. That way, both parties will have shared all the necessary information to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. \n\n### Propose multiple options whenever possible. \nIn negotiations, presenting only one option or solution can set you up for failure because the other person might think your first offer is the only one. If the other party rejects all of your proposals, ask them to communicate which one they like best, as that may point you in the direction of finding a solution that works for everyone.\n\n# Tips for navigating scope with stakeholders\n## Understand motivations. \nBefore your discussion, consider each stakeholder's motivations for wanting to adjust the project‚Äôs scope. Some of those motivations are budgetary (such as wanting to reduce the project‚Äôs costs), some are interpersonal (such as wanting more time to complete tasks), and some are related to personal career goals (such as maintaining their current position or striving for a promotion). Understanding your stakeholders‚Äô motivations can help you work together to find a compromise. \n\n## Set the scene. \nStart the discussion with a reflection on why you are meeting. Remind your stakeholders why you are engaged in this project, and assure them that you all share a common goal.\n\n## Listen first. \nHear what your stakeholders have to say before you present your views. This will demonstrate your desire to understand the other party‚Äôs perspective. Acknowledging their point of view may make it easier for them to accept your suggestions or solutions when their ideas or opinions differ from yours.\n\n## Ask questions to define goals. \nBe thorough and ask as many questions as you feel necessary to understand what the stakeholder wants. This might include getting them to define their customer or business goals. Strive for getting specific, measurable details from your stakeholders, so that later, you‚Äôll be able to determine whether you‚Äôve successfully met their goals. Eliciting language that is measurable (rather than subjective or unclear) will help you define goals. An example of a specific, measurable goal could be: ‚ÄúWe want to cut the amount of time it takes customers to sign up for our newsletter by at least 30 percent.‚Äù\n\n## Explain the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù before the ‚Äúwhat.‚Äù \nWhen attempting to persuade stakeholders‚Äîor anyone, for that matter‚Äîto see things your way, explain the reasons for your request before describing what you want. For instance, start by explaining the value that could be added to your company or project by defining scope in a certain way. If stakeholders understand where you‚Äôre coming from first, they‚Äôre more likely to grant your request when you ask for it.\n\n## Do not oversell. \nSometimes it‚Äôs best to state your case and give others some time to respond. After you have presented your reasons, position, and request, withdraw slightly to give your audience time to process what you have said. Think of your silence, in this situation, as a sign of respect for your stakeholders; it shows them you want to hear from them. And, if they are quiet for a while, it means that you have stimulated thought.  \n\n## Be creative. \nWorking to find alternative solutions can quickly turn a heavy negotiation into an inspiring team effort. To find real solutions to negotiation stalemates, think creatively about all the aspects of the project. You may find that there is more than one solution to differing opinions. \n\n## Do not make it personal. \nAlways focus on what is good for the project. If personal considerations enter into the discussion, reframe the conversation by bringing up objective facts.\n\n## Seek a win-win outcome. \nFinally, consider what it will take for the other side to be satisfied. Then, try to identify a way to ensure you are satisfied as well. There will be times when one party may have to compromise more than the other,  but a mutually beneficial agreement (an agreement that benefits all parties involved) should always be the goal. The next reading will cover strategies for achieving mutually beneficial agreements with stakeholders. \n","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T13:17:11.659920909Z","tags":null},"/project-initiation/okr":{"title":"OKR","content":"OKR: Objectives and Key Results\nOKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. \n\t- [Project goals](foundations-of-project-management/project-goals.md)\n\t- [Project metrics](project-execution/project-data/project-metrics.md)\n\t\nObjective:\n- Defines what needs to be achieved\n- Describes the desired outcome\n\nKey Results:\n- The measurable outcome that defines when the objective has been met\n\nOKR levels:\n- Company-level\n    - Shared across an organization so that everyone can align and focus their effort to help the company reach its goals\n- Department-level\n- Project-level\n    - Help define measurable project goals.

You may face ethical traps throughout the course of a project. However, ethics can be of particular concern when it comes to procurement. As you have learned, project managers must take precautions to ensure that they and their suppliers are following ethical principles during the procurement process. \n\n# Common ethical traps\nSometimes, potential ethical issues can be overlooked or can be considered the necessary cost of doing business. This is a dangerous line of thinking since these types of assumptions can put your project, company, and career at risk. To review what we discussed in the video, a few of the most common ethical traps that exist when conducting procurements are corruption and bribery, sole-supplier sourcing, and interactions with state-owned agencies.\n\n## Corruption and bribery   \nYou may be confronted with different types of corruption when going through the procurement process. One form of corruption is when a vendor seeks to reduce the competition for a contract during the bidding process. A company may attempt to bribe members within the organization to sway their decision into a favorable outcome for the vendor. Bribes may include things like money, gifts, tickets to events, and more. Another type of corruption scheme is to offer a certain percentage of an awarded contract‚Äîalso known as a kickback‚Äîto an official who can ensure that their company wins the bid.\n\n## Sole-supplier sourcing   \nIn some situations, having a vendor who a company is already familiar with smooths the procurement process and works well for both parties. Ethical issues arise when other vendors aren‚Äôt even allowed to bid for contracts for which they are similarly qualified. With sole-supplier sourcing, vendors may reach out to buyers before a bid is even requested. When the buyer‚Äôs organization decides to work with that vendor based on their previously-established relationship, that limits competition before the bidding has even begun. When this happens, companies and the public miss out on the advantages of competition, such as reasonable pricing, product quality standards, or speedy delivery options. \n\n## Interactions with state-owned entities\nThere are some instances in which government agencies require an organization to adhere to stricter ethical standards than they might have otherwise. Most government regulatory agencies exist because a company or an entire industry has ranked profits over their workers or the environment. Governmental agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, for example, keep businesses within legal and ethical standards. If you are unfamiliar with any governmental restrictions that may affect your industry, organization, or project, you could unintentionally fall into an ethical trap.\n\n# Avoiding ethical traps   \nHere are some guidelines that will help you avoid falling into ethical traps when it comes to procurement:\n\n## Understand the legal requirements for your procurements. \nEvery country has regulations to adhere to when conducting business in that country. Be sure to research the legal and ethical requirements based on your project and procurement needs, and if your organization has a legal team, make sure to lean on them for support and advice.\n\n## Stick to your ethical codes. \nHonesty, responsibility, respect, and fairness are the values that underpin ethical behavior in the project management profession. The Project Management Institute‚Äôs (PMI) code of ethics provides detailed guidelines to help ensure you maintain ethical conduct in your projects. \n\n## Test your ethics. \nWhen you face an ethical dilemma, ask yourself questions in each of the following categories:\n- Shame: Would you be ashamed if someone knew what you did?\n- Community: Would you want your friends to know the decision you made? \n- Legal: Would you face legal action if you took this action? \n- Situation: Would your actions be justified in this situation?\n- Consequence: Would a negative outcome be worth your actions?
