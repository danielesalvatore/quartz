# Agile project management
An approach to project and team management that embodies "agility" and is based on the Agile Manifesto. 

The Manifesto is a collection of four values and 12 principles that define the mindset that all Agile teams should strive for. 

- Emerged during the 1990s.
- [Agile manifesto](agile-project-management/agile-manifesto.md) in 2001: 
	- Thought leaders and creators came together to find common ground between their methods and solve a problem. The problem, they agreed, was that companies were so focused on planning and documenting their projects they lost sight of what really mattered: pleasing their customers.

- Agile values, principles, and frameworks have been applied to every industry
- Agile methods draw heavily on [Lean](foundations-of-project-management/project-management-methodology/lean.md) manufacturing principles.
