title: Common Agile coaching challenges
---
Common challenges:
- Managing a stable [Product roadmap](project-execution/product-roadmap.md)
- Incomplete implementation of [Scrum](agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md)
- Experiencing a lack of stability within the team 

# Managing a stable product roadmap
Unstable roadmap causes:
- Product ambition
- Product assumptions

## Product ambition
Example:
- Product leadership is overly ambitious about what the team can realistically deliver

Solutions:
- Agree up front how to handle new opportunities
- Set up regular roadmap reviews with the entire team
- Promote sharing knowledge between the [Product owner](agile-project-management/scrum/product-owner.md) and the [Development team (or Developers)](agile-project-management/scrum/development-team-or-developers.md)

## Product assumptions
Too many assumptions can jeopardize the team's success.

Solutions:
- Document the assumptions and make them transparent
- Check assumptions against unbiased user research
	- Gather information about what users really want
	- Allows you to confirm or reject assumptions

# Incomplete implementation of Scrum
- Loss of clear [Scrum roles](agile-project-management/scrum/scrum-roles.md) and responsibilities
- Tempted to skip some events or blend them to save time
- Not providing the team with the [Scrum](agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) coaching they need
	- [Coaching an Agile team](agile-project-management/applying-agile/coaching-an-agile-team.md)

Solutions:
- Implement [Scrum](agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) completely
- Make sure [Scrum roles](agile-project-management/scrum/scrum-roles.md) are well defined and properly fulfilled

# Experiencing a lack of stability within the team 
- Change in team composition

Solutions:
- Quick onboarding process
- Pair programming
- Have shorter [Sprint](agile-project-management/scrum/sprint.md)
