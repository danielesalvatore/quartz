title: Release plans
---
The dates on which a team expects to release a given feature to customers or users. 

- Release goal
	- What you want to release
- List of backlog items
- Estimated release date
- Other relevant dates that impact a release

# Tips
- The [Product owner](agile-project-management/scrum/product-owner.md) and the [Scrum Master](agile-project-management/scrum/scrum-master.md) must work together before releasing the plan
- Release plans need to connect the product roadmap with the team capacity and [Velocity](agile-project-management/scrum/velocity.md).
	- [Agile manifesto](agile-project-management/agile-manifesto.md#Team dynamics and culture)
- Factor in any "hard" dates or deadlines

# Common factors resulting in changes to the release plan
- Team [Velocity](agile-project-management/scrum/velocity.md) change
- Change to [Project scope](project-initiation/scope/project-scope.md)
- Improving the understanding of how much effort is needed to build certain features
- The [Product owner](agile-project-management/scrum/product-owner.md) and the [Scrum Master](agile-project-management/scrum/scrum-master.md) should always review the release plan before starting a [Sprint planning](agile-project-management/scrum/sprint-planning.md) session.
