- Flow of work

Kanban boards are a visual tool used to manage tasks and workflows. Kanban boards can be created on whiteboards, magnetic boards, poster boards, computer programs, and more. Tasks associated with the project are written on cards. These cards are placed in columns, which represent the progress made. 

Suitable for [Agile](agile-project-management/agile.md) projects, also called [Scrum](agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) board. 

## Purposes
Kanban boards are used to:
- Give a quick visual understanding of work details and provide critical task information.
- Facilitate handoffs between stakeholders, such as between development and testing resources or between team members who work on related tasks.
- Help with capturing metrics and improving workflows.

# Flow
A core principle of Kanban aims to maximize efficiency.
