This is where the team meets for 15 minutes or less every day of the [Sprint](agile-project-management/scrum/sprint.md) to inspect their progress toward their goal.

Time for the Team to sync, replying to the following questions:
- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Did I notice any blockers?
