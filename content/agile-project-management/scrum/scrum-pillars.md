[Scrum](agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) pillars:
- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation

# Transparency
Make the most significant aspects of our work visible to those responsible for the outcome. 

Transparency inside a Scrum team is critical to the team's productivity and the project's completion. 

# Inspection
Inspection refers to conducting timely checks towards the outcome of a [Sprint](agile-project-management/scrum/sprint.md) goal to detect undesirable variances.

The more inspections that take place, the more improvement a team experiences in their work.

# Adaptation
Adjusting projects, products, or processes to minimize any further deviation or issues.

Although adaptation includes immediate fixes to problems, it may also be about implementing a change, so future projects don't repeat past mistakes.
