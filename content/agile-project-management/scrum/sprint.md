The Sprint is the name of the time-boxed period in [Scrum](agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) where work is done.

Within a Sprint, the amount of work is planned based on the historical capacity of the team and is made ready for the [Sprint planning](agile-project-management/scrum/sprint-planning.md) event. 

Sprints are [Scrum events](agile-project-management/scrum/scrum-events.md#Timeboxes).
