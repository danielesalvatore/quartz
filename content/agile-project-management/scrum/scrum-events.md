# Timeboxes
Events are timeboxed:
- Create a sense of urgency that will drive prioritization
- Provide a window of focus that will translate into productivity gains
- Help the team develop a predictable rhythm to their work

How to define your timebox:
- Think about what you expect the frequency of changes to be
- Think about how much focused time your solution [Development team (or Developers)](agile-project-management/scrum/development-team-or-developers.md) needs to build a [Product backlog](agile-project-management/scrum/product-backlog.md) item. 
- Think about how much overhead goes into the "delivery" of your product
