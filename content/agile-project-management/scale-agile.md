---
Frameworks:
- [Scrum of Scrums](agile-project-management/scrum-of-scrums.md)
- [Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)](agile-project-management/scaled-agile-framework-safe.md)
- [Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)](agile-project-management/large-scale-scrum-less.md)
- [Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)](agile-project-management/disciplined-agile-delivery-dad.md)
- [The Spotify Model](agile-project-management/the-spotify-model.md)


# Best practices
- Treat scaling models like SAFe, Scrum of Scrums, LeSS, etc., as general frameworks, not instruction manuals. 
- Different situations require different solutions. It’s okay to mix and match elements from multiple frameworks, as long as you apply the principles and values of the [Agile manifesto](agile-project-management/agile-manifesto.md).
- Don’t try to scale without prior [Agile](agile-project-management/agile.md) experience. Going straight from Waterfall to scaled Agile can be risky without a knowledgeable guide.
- Finally, and most importantly, don’t scale if it isn’t necessary. The larger your team, the more complex and difficult your project becomes.
