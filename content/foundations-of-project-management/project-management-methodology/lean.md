Originated in the manufacturing world.

The main principle is the removal of waste in an operation. By optimizing steps and eliminating waste, the only value is added at each phase of production. 

Types of waste within an operation
- defects,
- excess processing,
- overproduction,
- waiting,
- inventory,
- transportation,
- motion,
- utilized talent.

The 5S method includes these five steps:
- Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials.
- Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away.
- Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.
- Standardize: Perform the process, in the same way, every time.
- Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.
