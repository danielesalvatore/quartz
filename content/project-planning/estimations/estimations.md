# Time estimations
A prediction of the total amount of time required to complete a task. It includes inactive time.

## Techniques specific to negotiating time estimates
- Say "no" without saying "no"
- Focus on interests, not positions
- Present [Negotiation](project-initiation/negotiation.md#Mutual benefit) options
- Insist on objective criteria

# Effort estimations
[Effort estimations](project-planning/estimations/effort-estimations.md)

## Example of difference between time and effort estimations
Task: paint a wall
Effort estimation: 30 mins
Time estimation: 24 hours, as it also includes the time to dry the wall.

Your teammates will have the most realistic understanding of the amount of work required to complete a task and will be able to provide the best estimate.
