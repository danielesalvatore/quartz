	- Divide any deliverable contained in the [Project charter](project-initiation/project-charter.md) into milestones.
- Give yourself time to plan
	- Use [Effort estimations](project-planning/estimations/effort-estimations.md) and [Capacity planning](project-planning/estimations/capacity-planning.md) to determine how long the project will take.
- Recognize and plan for the inevitable: things will go wrong.
	- Use [Buffers](project-planning/estimations/buffers.md)
- Stay curious
	- You cannot be an expert on everything, so [Getting accurate time estimates from your team](project-planning/estimations/getting-accurate-time-estimates-from-your-team.md).
- Champion your plan
	- Consider your plan as the single source of truth.
