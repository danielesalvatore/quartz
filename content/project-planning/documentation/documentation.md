Documentation storage and sharing are very important. 
Having plans in one place makes communication quicker, easier, and more streamlined. 

Documenting and organizing plans provides visibility and accountability. 

Having up-to-date plans will help ensure there's no room for misconfiguration. 

Not everyone needs full access to project documentation. 

Summarize relevant information for whose who need to stay informed of final outcomes, but don't need all the background information. 

Documenting plans in one place provides continuity. 

Store project documentation in a centralized place that is clearly labeled. 

Make sure people in relevant roles are granted access to documents so that even in your absence, the project can carry on.
