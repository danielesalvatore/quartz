I am excited to share with you my Google Project Management Professional Certificate!

I decided to complete this specialization, available at https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management, to assess a set of skills I use daily and to improve my knowledge of topics I am passionate about. 

To celebrate, I decided to publish the notes I took during the journey: I hope they can be helpful to anyone interested!

My notes about Project Management are available at:

As you may recall, I am passionate about data visualization too. 
I had fun visualizing the course topics using a web-based Interactive Graph that shows how the page topic relates to the other topics. A different graph is available on each page of the note website. 

Have you ever visualized information using graphs? Do you find it helpful?
