title: Project closing

Project closing is the process performed to formally complete the project, the current phase, and contractual obligations. 

You can choose between a small, closing process at the end of each milestone, or a formal, larger comprehensive closing phase at the very end only. 

# Steps to conducting a closing process after each phase or milestone
- Refer to prior documentation:
	- [Statement of Work (SoW)](project-initiation/procurement/statement-of-work-sow.md)
	- [Common procurement documentation](project-initiation/procurement/common-procurement-documentation.md#Request for Proposal RFP)
	- [Tools to identify risks](project-planning/risk-management/tools-to-identify-risks.md#Risk register)
	- [RACI chart](project-initiation/raci-chart.md)
- Put together closing documentation
- Conduct administrative closure of the procurement process
- Make sure all stakeholders are aware that a phase, or project, is ending. 
- Execute necessary follow-up work

# Steps to conducting a closing process at the end of the project
