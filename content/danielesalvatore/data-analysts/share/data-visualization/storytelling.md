title: Storytelling
---
The process of turning facts into a narrative to communicate something to your audience. 

Many experts believe that human brains automatically organize events with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Thinking about things in this way, like stories, helps us make sense of the past, the present, and the future.

"Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them a clear and convincing voice." Stephen Few

Narrative's elements:
- Characters
	- The people affecred by your story, like [Stakeholders](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/stakeholders.md)
- Setting
	- What’s happening and other background info
- Plot (a.k.a the conflict)
	- The plot is what creates the conflict that compels the characters to act—and what the data analysis seeks to resolve
	- Plot creates tension in the situation.
- Big reveal
	- how data solves the problem
- Aha moment
	- data-driven recommendations

- Choose a visual representation
	- [Data visualization](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/share/data-visualization/data-visualization.md)
