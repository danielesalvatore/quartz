Frameworks for organizing your thoughts about visualization
Frameworks can help you organize your thoughts about data visualization and give you a useful checklist to reference. Here are two frameworks that may be useful for you as you create your own data viz: 

1) The McCandless Method

You learned about the David McCandless method in the first lesson on effective data visualizations, but as a refresher, the McCandless Method lists four elements of good data visualization: 
- Information: the data you are working with
- Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept
- Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual
- Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

Note: One useful way of approaching this framework is to notice the parts of the graphic where there is incomplete overlap between all four elements. For example, visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art. Data plus visual form without a goal or function is eye candy. Data with a goal but no story or visual form is boring. All four elements need to be at work to create an effective visual.

2) Kaiser Fungâ€™s Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup

This approach is a useful set of questions that can help consumers of data visualization critique what they are consuming and determine how effective it is. The Checkup has three questions:
- What is the practical question? 
- What does the data say?
- What does the visual say? 

Note: This checklist helps you think about your data viz from the perspective of your audience and decide if your visual is communicating your data effectively to them or not. In addition to these frameworks, there are some other building blocks that can help you construct your data visualizations. 

Pre-attentive attributes: marks and channels
Creating effective visuals means leveraging what we know about how the brain works, and then using specific visual elements to communicate the information effectively. Pre-attentive attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort. The essential, basic building blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels. 

Marks
Marks are basic visual objects like points, lines, and shapes. Every mark can be broken down into four qualities: 

Position - Where a specific mark is in space in relation to a scale or to other marks

2. Size - How big, small, long, or tall a mark is

a plot with points that are different sizes
3. Shape - Whether a specific object is given a shape that communicates something about it

4. Color - What color the mark is

Channels
Channels are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data. Channels are basically marks that have been used to visualize data. Channels will vary in terms of how effective they are at communicating data based on three elements: 

1. Accuracy - Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented? 

For example, color is very accurate when communicating categorical differences, like apples and oranges. But it is much less effective when distinguishing quantitative data like 5 from 5.5.

2. Popout - How easy is it to distinguish certain values from others? 

There are many ways of drawing attention to specific parts of a visual, and many of them leverage pre-attentive attributes like line length, size, line width, shape, enclosure, hue, and intensity.

3. Grouping - How good is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data? 

Consider the proximity, similarity, enclosure, connectedness, and continuity of the channel.

But, remember: the more you emphasize different things, the less that emphasis counts. The more you emphasize one single thing, the more that counts.
