title: Avoiding misleading or deceptive charts

# Cutting off the y-axis

Changing the scale on the y-axis can make the differences between different groups in your data seem more dramatic, even if the difference is actually quite small. 

# Misleading use of a dual y-axis

Using a dual y-axis without clearly labeling it in your data visualization can create extremely misleading charts. 

# Artificially limiting the scope of the data

If you only consider the part of the data that confirms your analysis, your visualizations will be misleading because they don’t take all of the data into account. 

# Problematic choices in how data is binned or grouped

It is important to make sure that the way you are grouping data isn’t misleading or misrepresenting your data and disguising important trends and insights. 

# Using part-to-whole visuals when the totals do not sum up appropriately 

If you are using a part-to-whole visual like a pie chart to explain your data, the individual parts should add up to equal 100%. If they don’t, your data visualization will be misleading. 

# Hiding trends in cumulative charts

Creating a cumulative chart can disguise more insightful trends by making the scale of the visualization too large to track any changes over time. 

# Artificially smoothing trends

Adding smooth trend lines between points in a scatterplot can make it easier to read that plot, but replacing the points with just the line can actually make it appear that the point is more connected over time than it actually was.
