Design principles
Once you understand the pre-attentive attributes of data visualization, you can go on to design principles for creating effective visuals. These design principles are important to your work as a data analyst because they help you make sure that you are creating visualizations that communicate your data effectively to your audience. By keeping these rules in mind, you can plan and evaluate your data visualizations to decide if they are working for you and your goals. And, if they aren’t, you can adjust them! 

Principle

Description

Choose the right visual

One of the first things you have to decide is which visual will be the most effective for your audience. Sometimes, a simple table is the best visualization. Other times, you need a more complex visualization to illustrate your point. 

Optimize the data-ink ratio

The data-ink entails focusing on the part of the visual that is essential to understanding the point of the chart. Try to minimize non-data ink like boxes around legends or shadows to optimize the data-ink ratio.

Use orientation effectively

Make sure the written components of the visual, like the labels on a bar chart, are easy to read. You can change the orientation of your visual to make it easier to read and understand. 

Color

There are a lot of important considerations when thinking about using color in your visuals. These include using color consciously and meaningfully, staying consistent throughout your visuals, being considerate of what colors mean to different people, and using inclusive color scales that make sense for everyone viewing them.

Numbers of things

Think about how many elements you include in any visual. If your visualization uses lines, try to plot five or fewer. If that isn’t possible, use color or hue to emphasize important lines. Also, when using visuals like pie charts, try to keep the number of segments to less than seven since too many elements can be distracting.
