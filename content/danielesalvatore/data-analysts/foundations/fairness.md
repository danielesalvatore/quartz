title: Fairness
---
A quality of [Data analysis](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/foundations/data-analysis.md) that does not create or reinforce bias 

Examples:
- Making sure a sample population represents all groups
- Considering systematic factors that may influence data
- Factoring in social contexts that could create bias in conclusions
- Collect the data in an objective way
-   Think through the "who, what, where, when, how, and why" of your data

# Unfair question
A question that makes assumptions or is difficult to answer honestly
