title: Data analyst
---
It is someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions.

It is the collection of [Data](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/foundations/data.md) in order to draw conclusions and make data-informed decisions.

Data by itself wonâ€™t help make data-informed decisions. A [Project manager](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md) must analyze the data to draw conclusions and make predictions.
