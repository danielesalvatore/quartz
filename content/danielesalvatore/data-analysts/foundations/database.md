# Relational database
A database that contains a series of related tables that can be connected via their relationship.

## Database Normalization
Normalization is a process of organizing data in a relational database. For example, creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables. It is applied to eliminate data redundancy, increase data integrity, and reduce complexity in a database.
