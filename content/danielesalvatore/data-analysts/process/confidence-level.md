title: Confidence level
---
How confident you are in the survey results.
The probability that your [Sample](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/prepare/sample.md) accurately reflects the greater [Population](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/prepare/population.md)

For example, a 95% confidence level means that if you were to run the same survey 100 times, you would get similar results 95 of those 100 times. 

Confidence level is targeted before you start your study because it will affect how big your margin of error is at the end of your study.
