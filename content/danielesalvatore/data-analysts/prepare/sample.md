# Sample size

Minimum 30.

This recommendation is based on the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** in the field of probability and statistics. As sample size increases, the results more closely resemble the normal (bell-shaped) distribution from a large number of samples. A sample of 30 is the smallest sample size for which the CLT is still valid. Researchers who rely on **regression analysis** – statistical methods to determine the relationships between controlled and dependent variables – also prefer a minimum sample of 30.

-   [Sample Size Formula](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/dissertation-resources/sample-size-calculation-and-sample-size-justification/sample-size-formula/ "Sample Size Formula"): This article by Statistics Solutions provides a little more detail about why some researchers use 30 as a minimum sample size.
