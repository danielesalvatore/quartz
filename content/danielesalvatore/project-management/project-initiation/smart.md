SMART:
- Specific
- Measurable - To objectively meet the goal
- Attainable (or Action-oriented)
- Relevant
- Time-bound

# Specific
- What do I want to accomplish?
- Why is this a goal?
- Who is involved?
- Where should the goal be delivered?
- To what degree?

Look for subjective words (e.g. bigger, better, faster) and agree with [Stakeholders](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/stakeholders.md) on what they actually mean.
# Measurable
- How much?
- How many?
- How will I know when Iâ€™ll be accomplished?
- Metrics are used to measure a goal.
- Benchmark, or point of time, to compare with the past
# Attainable / Action-oriented
- Can it be reasonably met?
- How can it be accomplished? Split complexity to assess
# Relevant
- Does the goal make sense?
- Are the goals worthwhile?
- Is it the right time?
# Time-bound
- The goal has a deadline.
