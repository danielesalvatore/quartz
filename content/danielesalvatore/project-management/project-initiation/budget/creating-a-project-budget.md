title: Creating a project budget
---
Techniques:
- Historical data
	- Review past projects similar to the new one
- Leverage experts
	- Gather experts' insights about the project budget
- Bottom-up
	- Think about all the components of a project, from the beginning to the end
	- Ask vendors for quotes
- Confirm accuracy
	- Double-check
- Baseline the budget
	- It is the dollar amount that you'll use to measure against, to find out if you're on track or not, and to measure the success of your project. 


Bottom-up approach phases:
- Break the project into tasks
- Estimate the cost of each item
- Add estimates together
- Add contingency and tax
- Seek approval from key stakeholders

Bottom-up > Cost estimates > Material costs > Fixed costs > Buffers and reserves (5% is a standard) > Planned vs Actual costs.

## Goal
Make the final cost as possible to the estimated cost.
