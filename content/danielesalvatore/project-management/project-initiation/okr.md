OKR: Objectives and Key Results
OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. 
	- [Project goals](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project-goals.md)
	- [Project metrics](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-execution/project-data/project-metrics.md)
	
Objective:
- Defines what needs to be achieved
- Describes the desired outcome

Key Results:
- The measurable outcome that defines when the objective has been met

OKR levels:
- Company-level
    - Shared across an organization so that everyone can align and focus their effort to help the company reach its goals
- Department-level
- Project-level
    - Help define measurable project goals. They need to align with and support both company and department-level OKRs

Strong objectives meet the following criteria. 

They are:
- Aspirational
- Aligned with organizational goals
- Action-oriented
- Concrete
- Significant

Strong key results meet the following criteria:
- Results-oriented - not a task
- Measurable and verifiable
- Specific and time-bound
- Aggressive yet realistic

OKRs can be really helpful to reference when [Communicating project problems](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-execution/communicating-project-problems.md) with [Stakeholders](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/stakeholders.md), making a reference between the problem and the impacted OKR, to invite the stakeholders to take the problem seriuosly.
