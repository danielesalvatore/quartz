---
Governance in business is the management framework within which decisions are made and accountability and responsibility are determined.

Governance is understanding who is in change.

- Corporate governance
    - Set of standards and best practices defined by an organisation
    - It influences projects
    - Framework by which an organisation achieves its goals and objectives
    - Hand-in-hand with change management
- Project governance
    - Framework for how project decisions are made

How an organisation aligns its project governance with its corporate management:
- By considering the long-term and short-term interests in the organisation
- By making thoughtful decisions about which projects to take on and avoiding projects if they donâ€™t have sufficient resources
- By providing stakeholders with timely, relevant, and reliable information
