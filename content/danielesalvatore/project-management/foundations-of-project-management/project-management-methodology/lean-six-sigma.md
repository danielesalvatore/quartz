title: Lean Six Sigma
---
It is the combination of two methodologies:

- [Lean](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project-management-methodology/lean.md)
- [Six Sigma](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project-management-methodology/six-sigma.md)

When the team feels value, motivation and productivity increase, and the whole process works more smoothly.

Phases:
- Define
    - Define the project goal and talk to stakeholders about expectations for the projects
    - Similar to the initiation of the traditional project management phase
- Measure
    - Gather data
- Analyze
    - Identify gaps and issues
- Improve
    - The present finds and starts the improvement
- Control
    - Learn from the work you did to put new processes and documentation in place

The largest difference between Lean and Six Sigma methodologies is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from the beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met. You may find that one of these two methods—or using them both together—can improve the efficiency of your projects.
