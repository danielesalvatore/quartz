title: Techniques to help manage risks
---
If you can manage [Change](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-execution/change.md), [Tasks dependencies](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/estimations/tasks-dependencies.md), and [Scope creep](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/scope/scope-creep.md) other types of risks become much easier to manage.

If your dependencies are met on time, your team is less likely to fall behind schedule. If your scope is tightly-managed, you're less likely to incur changes to your budget or be forced to extend your timeline.
