title: Escalation
---
The process of enlisting the help of higher-level project leadership or management to remove an obstacle, clarify or reinforce priorities, and validate the next steps. 

- Act as chacks and balancers
- Generate speedy decision making
- Reduce frustrations
- Encourage participation

Before starting work on a project, the [Project manager](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md), the team, and the [Project sponsor](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-sponsor.md) should establish escalation standards and practices. 

A project manager should escalate an issue at the first sign of critical problems in a project:
- Cause a delay on a major project milestone
- Cause budget overruns
- Can result in the loss of customer
- Push back the estimated project completion date
- In short, anything that can affect your [Triple constraints model](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/scope/triple-constraints-model.md)

Trench wars occur when two peers or groups can't seem to come to an agreement, and neither party is willing to give in.

A bad compromise occurs when two parties settle on a so-called solution but the end product still suffers.
