title: Retrospective
---
A workshop or meeting that gives project teams time to reflect on a project. 

Performed after a [Project](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project/project.md) is completed. 

# Main purposes
- Encourage team building
	- Sharing the different points of view in the team
- Facilitate improved collaboration on future projects
- Promote positive changes

The emphasis in retrospectives is on [Continuous improvements](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-execution/continuous-improvements/continuous-improvements.md) and [Change](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-execution/change.md), instead of recycling old and potentially bad habits, procedures, and processes. 

# Best practices
- Ensure discussion is blameless
	- Changing perspective
	- Switching from "you" language to "we" language
- Reflect on the positive aspects of the project as well as the negatives
- Put the changes in place
- Maintain a positive tune throughout the retrospective
- Consider teams outside of your own to be part of the activity
- Ask open-ended, probing questions. 
- Cover the many aspects of the Sprint when conducting a retrospective.
	- The productivity and efficiency of the team
	- The scope and understanding of the definition of done
	- Communication and interactions within the team
	- Stakeholder communication
	- Progress towards more long-range release plans
- Consider reflecting periodically on Scrum [Scrum principles](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum-principles.md) and [Scrum values](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum-values.md) by asking specific questions. 

# Pitfalls
- Avoid too many gimmicks. 
	- There are many fun games and exercises that can be used by a Scrum Master when facilitating a Sprint Retrospective. However, not all teams enjoy this style. Consider using these exercises only occasionally or when the team asks for new ways of doing retrospectives.
- Try not to only focus on the negative. 
- Avoid changing processes after each retrospective. 

# Six thinking hats technique
- The blue hat manages the meeting, 
- The white hat puts all the information on the table, 
- The red hat puts all the feelings on the table, 
- The yellow hat finds solutions and brings optimism, 
- The green hat creates new ideas  
- The black hat finds risks. 

# Encouraging participation
 - Establish a safe environment for the team, 
 - Model the kind of participation you'd like to elicit from your team, 
 - Pose a group question and ask for individual responses
 - Review the project timeline.

# Encouraging accountability
Accountability: being responsibile for decisions associated with a project or task. 

Accountability and blame are two very different things, and only accountability belongs to retrospective.

- Encourages the team to think holistically about mistakes and challanges
- Identifies solution for the future
- Enrourage ownership

## Techniques
- Come prepared with specific challenges to discuss a a group
- Turn team complaints into [SMART](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/smart.md) action items
- Push the team to identify its role in creating a given challenge
- Detach the challenge being discussed from any specific person in the room 

# Techniques to address negativity
- Aims to set a positive tone at the start of the meeting
- Determine how you'll set the tone of the meeting
- Try anciticipating potential negativing by meeting one on one with team members before the retrospective happens
- Cosider asking team members individually to share their thoughts
- Call a meeting break
