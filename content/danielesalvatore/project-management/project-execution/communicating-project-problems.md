title: Communicating project problems
---
Communicating project problems is a part of the job of the [Project manager](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md).

It's also [Project manager](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md)'s responsibility to synthesize relevant information from multiple sources into a coherent summary that clearly communicates the issue. 

Synthesizing requires gathering information from multiple sources and using those points to help form your own analysis.
