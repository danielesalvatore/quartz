title: Burndown chart
---
A burndown chart is a line chart that measures the time against the amount of work done and the amount of work remaining.
 
- Useful for projects that require a granular, broken-down look at each task.
- Useful for projects where finishing on time is the top priority
- When applied in [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md), it measures the completed [User stories](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/user-stories.md) against the remaining. 
	- If the team is using [Estimates](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/estimates.md#T-shirt sizes) map each size to a number.
	- How many points a teams burns is called [Velocity](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/velocity.md)
