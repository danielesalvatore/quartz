Bruce Truckman's stage of [Team](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/team.md) development:
- Forming
- Storming
- Norming
- Performing
- Adjourning

## Forming
- Team gets to know one another
- [Project manager](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md) should clarify the project goals, roles, and context of the project
- Done during the [Make a plan](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project/life-cycle/make-a-plan.md) project phase. 
## Storming
- As people settle into their roles and the work on their project begins, the people on your team are interacting more and maybe disagreeing a bit. Frustration may emerge.
- [Project manager](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md) should focus on conflict resolution, lister as the team addresses problem to solve, and share insights on how the team might better function as a unit.
## Norming
- Conflict is mostly resolved and team is working together.
- [Project manager](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md) should codify the team norms, ensure that the team is aware of those norms, and reinforc them when needed. 
## Performing
- Team work together seamlessy
- Project manager should focus on delegating, motivating, and providing feedback to keep up the team's momentum
## Adjourning
- Project wraps up
- Team disbands
- Celebrate final milestones and successes
