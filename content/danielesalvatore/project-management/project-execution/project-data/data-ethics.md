title: Data ethics
---
Data ethics is well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used. 

For instance, the data a [Project manager](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md) collects during a project can contain [PII (personally identifiable information)](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-execution/project-data/pii-personally-identifiable-information.md).

Data ethics is the study and evaluation of moral challenges related to data collection and analysis. 
This includes generating, recording, curating, processing, sharing, and using data in order to come up with ethical solutions.

Businesses apply data ethics practices so they can:
- Comply with regulations
- Show that they are trustworthy
- Ensure fair and reasonable data usage
- Minimize biases
- Develop a positive public perception

Aspects:
- Ownership
	- Individuals own the raw data they provide and they have primary control over its usage, how it's processed, and how it's shared
- Transaction transparency
	- All data-processing activities and algorithms should be completely explainable and understood by the individual who provides their data
- Consent
	- An individual's right to know explicit details about how and why their data will be used before agreeing to provide it
- Currency
	- Individuals should be aware of financial transactions resulting from the use of their personal data and the scale of these transactions. 
- Privacy
	- [Data privacy](danielesalvatore/data-analysts/prepare/data-privacy.md)
