[Evaluation](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-execution/quality-management/evaluation.md) presentation process:
- Consider your audience
	- What's most meaningful to them?
- Present the same data in different ways
- Create a detailed evaluation report
	- Summarize the information into the most appropriate format for a given audience

- Take turns with teammates sharing what you think the data means

Shape the story of your findings by tying it all together into one cohesive narrative.

- Is more than raw data
- Needs to reflect what the data means
