title: Projects to avoid
---
Types of [Project](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project/project.md) to avoid:
- Never-ending projects
- Abandoned projects

# Never-ending projects
- They exist when the project deliverables and tasks cannot be completed.
- As a project manager, you must protect the [Project scope](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/scope/project-scope.md) to avoid becoming a never-ending project.  
# Abandoned projects
- When inadequate handoff or transition on the project deliverables occurs.
