title: Project plan's Best practices
---
Best practices:
- Carefully review deliverables, milestones, and tasks.
	- Divide any deliverable contained in the [Project charter](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/project-charter.md) into milestones.
- Give yourself time to plan
	- Use [Effort estimations](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/estimations/effort-estimations.md) and [Capacity planning](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/estimations/capacity-planning.md) to determine how long the project will take.
- Recognize and plan for the inevitable: things will go wrong.
	- Use [Buffers](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/estimations/buffers.md)
- Stay curious
	- You cannot be an expert on everything, so [Getting accurate time estimates from your team](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/estimations/getting-accurate-time-estimates-from-your-team.md).
- Champion your plan
	- Consider your plan as the single source of truth.
