- A project plan is an extensive document that includes project risks, budget, organization, scope, goals, objectives, and also project schedule. On the other hand, project schedules involve planned dates and sequences of project activities. 
- A project plan focuses on the entire project. On the other hand, project schedules focus on the project activities, start and finish dates, and [Tasks dependencies](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/estimations/tasks-dependencies.md).
