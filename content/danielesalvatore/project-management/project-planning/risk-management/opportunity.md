title: Opportunity
---
An opportunity is a potentially positive outcome of a [Risk](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/risk-management/risk.md). 

To identify an opportunity, apply the same phases of the [Risk management phases](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/risk-management/risk-management-phases.md).

Example of opportunities:
- Completing a milestone ahead of schedule
- Discounted materials 
- Availability of additional resources (people, investments, equipment)
