title: Type of risks
---
Common risks types:
- Time risks
	- The possibility that project tasks will take longer than anticipated to complete.
	- Refers to [Project schedule](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/project-plan/project-schedule.md)
- [Budget](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/budget/budget.md) risks
	- The possibility that the costs of a project will increase due to poor [Project planning](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/project-planning.md) or expanding the project's scope. 
- [Project scope](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/scope/project-scope.md) risks
	- The possibility that a project won't produce the results outlined in the [Project goals](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project-goals.md)


# External risks
Risks resulting from factors outside the company

# Single point of failure
A risk that has the potential to be catastrophic and halt work across a project. 

# Dependencies risks
Because [Tasks dependencies](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/estimations/tasks-dependencies.md) are the links that connect one project task to another, they are often a huge source of risk to a project. 
If you don't plan for dependencies, you might risk an impact on your budget, schedule, or project outcome.
