- Aims to improve product quality and the ability to respond to changing customer needs
- Takes best practices for the development process to "extreme" levels

XP wants to ensure that all of the pieces of the product will fit together properly. So it stresses simplicity.

# Phases
- Designing
	- XP wants to ensure that all of the pieces of the product will fit together properly. So it stresses simplicity.
- Coding
	- XP demands clear and concise code, so that others can easily read and understand the program.
- Testing
	- The goal is to test for and elinimate any flaws in a feature before building it and continuing on. 
- Listening
	- Listening to the customer and ensuring that the requirements are integrated into the proeuct. 

# Innovative practices
- Pair programming
- Continuous integration and continuous refactoring
- Avoid big design up front
- Write tests, not requirements
