title: Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
---
The most popular scaled framework is the Scaled Agile Framework or SAFe. 

SAFe is a [Lean](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project-management-methodology/lean.md)-[Agile](danielesalvatore/.trash/agile.md) scaling framework that draws heavily on concepts from [Kanban](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/kanban.md), [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md), [Extreme programming (XP)](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/extreme-programming-xp.md), [DevOps](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/devops.md), and Design Thinking methodologies. 

SAFe puts the goal of delivering value above all else - the first principle of SAFe is “take an economic view.” The framework organizes all work and teams into “Agile Release Trains” based on value streams; for example, sales. 

The SAFe framework is mature and provides detailed guidance on all elements of using SAFe, but some elements are more critical than others. Be sure to check back to the Agile principles and values in the manifesto to be sure you are preserving agility. 

SAFe, like most Agile practices, is founded on a set of core values:
- Alignment: Synchronize the planning and execution of SAFe activities at all levels of the organization. 
- Built-in Quality: Build quality into all stages of solution development. 
- Transparency: Make execution activities visible at all levels to build trust among teams and across the organization. 
- Program Execution: Focus on working systems and business outcomes. 
- Leadership: Model the values and principles of SAFe.
