title: Distinguishing Agile from Waterfall
---
[Agile](danielesalvatore/.trash/agile.md) is an iterative process, and [Waterfall](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project-management-methodology/waterfall.md) is more linear. Both have their merits, depending on the project.

- [Agile](danielesalvatore/.trash/agile.md) was created in response to the strict linear process of [Waterfall](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project-management-methodology/waterfall.md)
- [Agile](danielesalvatore/.trash/agile.md) embraces the reality that the world, customer markets, and users are uncertain and unpredictable.

- Agile aims to get customer feedback more quickly
- Working with an Agile mindset means always finding ways to work more efficiently by focusing on streamlining the process without reducing product quality or value.
- Waterfall aims for predictability and tries to avoid change, while Agile embraces the reality that the world is uncertain and unpredictable.

Aspects of a [Project](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project/project.md):
- [Project requirements](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project/project-requirements.md)
	- Waterfall: formal documents approved at the beginning of the project. The goal is to minimize the [Scope creep](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-initiation/scope/scope-creep.md).
	- Agile: dynamic requirements and frequent change. Follow an informal process to change requirements; 
- [Documentation](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-planning/documentation/documentation.md)
	- Waterfall: a lot of documentation to support all the handoffs between phases
	- Agile: emphasis on real-time conversation.
- [Project deliverables](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project-deliverables.md)
	- Waterfall: big release the deliverable at the end of the project
	- Agile: frequent release
