- Retrospective and continuous learning

## [Value](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/applying-agile/value.md) delivery
Delivering the work as quickly as possible to get feedback and mitigate time risk.

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Simplify - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
	- Simplify allows a team to work on the things that matter most. 
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 

## Business collaboration
Collaborating with your customers helps the team get critical business information immediately, allowing them to adjust and adapt to any new information. 

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. 
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 

## Team dynamics and culture
Create an effective team culture that is inclusive, supportive, and empowering. 

- Build projects around motivated individuals. give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. 
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

Make sure your team:
- Is motivated to do the right thing
- Feels trusted to do the right thing
- Has the resources and space to work closely together on their goals

## Retrospective and continuous learning
Strive to continuously learn and adapt to what's working and what's not. 

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
