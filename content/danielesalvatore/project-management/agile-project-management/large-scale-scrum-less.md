title: Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)
---
Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) is a framework that aims to maximize the Scrum team’s ability to deliver value and reduce waste in larger organizations. LeSS grew out of more than 600 experiments that expanded the practice of Scrum to larger groups. 

LeSS includes ten principles for applying the value, elements, and overall purpose of Scrum across an organization. These principles were designed to create more customer- and collaboration-focused teams. LeSS teams prioritize learning, transparency, and customer needs. 

The ten LeSS principles are:
- Large-scale Scrum is Scrum: Apply the values and principles of Scrum to a larger team. 
- Empirical process control: Inspect, adapt, and learn from experience to improve processes. 
- Transparency: Ensure clarity and accessibility across a project. 
- More with less: Create only necessary processes, roles, artifacts, and waste when scaling. 
- Whole-product focus: Think holistically about the product, making sure that all the parts serve the whole.
- Customer-centric: Keep the customer’s needs and values at the heart of your process.
- Continuous improvement towards perfection: Improve the product—and your process—during every single Sprint. 
- Systems thinking: Think about the system as a whole; Don’t get lost in the details. 
- Lean thinking: Seek continuous improvement, aim for perfection, and respect people.
- Queuing theory: Embrace the Lean principles of “flow,’ manage queue size,” and “minimize multitasking” to keep delivering value. 

The LeSS toolkit provides two frameworks—one for up to about 50 people (called Basic LeSS) and one for 50–6000+ people (called LeSS Huge).
