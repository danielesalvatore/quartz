# Managing
- [Project manager's responsibilities](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-managers-responsibilities.md)
- In [Agile](danielesalvatore/.trash/agile.md) teams are self-organizing
	- [Agile manifesto](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/agile-manifesto.md#Team dynamics and culture)

# Coaching
- Two-way communication style aimed at [Influencing](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-execution/effective-teams/influencing.md) and developing team members’ skills
- Coaching empowers team members to arrive at solutions on their own by teaching them critical thinking and decision-making skills

Principles:
- Motivate
- Support
- Encourage and appreciate: 

# Motivate
Coaches motivate team members to take action. They point out the value in others’ work and instill within them a sense of pride in what they do. 

# Support
Coaches are an accessible resource for their team to come to when they experience problems or if they have an idea they want their feedback on. 

# Encourage and appreciate
When someone on their team is struggling with a heavy workload, a coach will acknowledge and validate the weight of their efforts and assure them that they are capable of handling the challenges ahead.
