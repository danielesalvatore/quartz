Value-driven delivery means you and your team are focused on delivering a product of high [Value](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/applying-agile/value.md).

How to ensure you are building something value-driven:

	- Understand what your customer really wants
		- [Agile manifesto](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/agile-manifesto.md#Working software over comprehensive documentation) extends beyond just the team
	- Responsibility in [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md): [Product owner](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-owner.md) 
- Build the thing right
	- Ensure that the team only builds the requested or approved features
	- Responsibility in [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md): [Development team (or Developers)](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/development-team-or-developers.md)
- Run it right
	- Your team has thought through the user will interact with the product once it's been delivered
