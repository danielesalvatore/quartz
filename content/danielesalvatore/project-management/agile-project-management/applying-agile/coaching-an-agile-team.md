Coaching:
- Design the "plays" with the team
- Provide feedback to the team
- Celebrate and learn with the team

# Design the "plays" with the team
Although the [Scrum Master](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum-master.md) owns the playbook of [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md), it should be created with the whole team. 

# Provide feedback to the team
Provide feedback to [Stakeholders](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/stakeholders.md) and the team as early as possible. 
Both positive and negative feedback, as during [Retrospective](danielesalvatore/project-management/project-execution/retrospective.md).

# Celebrate and learn with the team
Acknowledge the achievement of the team.
