title: User stories
---
User stories are concise, specific descriptions of a feature told from the userâ€™s perspective. 
They allow the team to create solutions centered on the user experience and help project managers capture and manage the [Product backlog](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-backlog.md).

# Format
- User role
- Action
- Benefit

As a "User role" I want this "Action" so that I can get this "Benefit".

# INVEST

	- Each user story should be negotiable in terms of effort
- Valuable
	- Should be value to the project
- Estimable
	- Can be identified as the effort to complete the item
- Small
	- User stories should not be big unless they are low in the [Product backlog](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-backlog.md)
