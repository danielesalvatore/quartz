title: Sprint review
---
Done at the end of the [Sprint](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/sprint.md).

A meeting with the entire Scrum Team where the product is demonstrated in order to determine which aspects are finished and which aren't.

- Exploration of which items should be considered done ([Definition of done](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/definition-of-done.md)) in the [Product backlog](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-backlog.md).
- Demonstrate and inspect the product.

Should not exceed four hours.

Benefits:
- It makes the feedback as immediate as possible
- Everyone has a voice (sense of ownership)
- The team learns more about how other team members do their job, leading to greater trust and understanding between team members.
