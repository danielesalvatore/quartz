title: Product backlog
---
The central artifact in [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md), where all possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are captured for the team to work on.

Product backload is the single authoritative source for things that a team works on and contains all of the features, requirements, and activities associated with deliverables to achieve the [Project goals](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project-goals.md).

The equivalent in project management is the setup of [Project requirements](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/project/project-requirements.md).

- Living artifact
- Owned and adjusted by the [Product owner](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-owner.md).
- Prioritized list of features

# Best practices

## The value
The value indicates how much value the item brings to customers or stakeholders.

# Refinement
Backlog refinement is the act of keeping the [Product backlog](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-backlog.md) described, estimated, and prioritized so that the Scrum Team can operate effectively.

## Product backlog review
Review the [Product backlog](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-backlog.md) to ensure:
	- It contains the appropriate items, and nothing news is needed or nothing needs to be removed.
	- Ensure that the items are prioritized by the [Product owner](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-owner.md), this is also called setting the order field
	- That the items at the top of the [Product backlog](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-backlog.md) are ready for delivery with clear acceptance criteria
	- And that the [Product backlog](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-backlog.md) items include estimates or an informed assessment about how much work a particular item will require
