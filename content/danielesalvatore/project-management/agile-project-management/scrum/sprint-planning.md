title: Sprint planning
---
The entire [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) Team comes together and meets to confirm how much capacity, meaning time and people, are available during the [Sprint](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/sprint.md).

This becomes the [Sprint backlog](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/sprint-backlog.md) and ultimately the Sprint goal. 

[Scrum Master](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum-master.md) facilitates the event, asking questions like:
- What has been our average velocity, meaning how many points or Backlog items have we been able to complete in a single Sprint in the past? 
- What can and should be accomplished by the team in this upcoming Sprint?
- What is the ultimate Sprint goal?Â 
- How will the work get done?
- Throughout the Sprint, who is responsible for what tasks?
