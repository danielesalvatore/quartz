- Overlapping development phases
- Multi-learning
- Subtle control
- Organizational transfer of learning

# Built-in instability
In the [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) world, teams are given the freedom to achieve important outcomes with “challenging requirements.” Takeuchi and Nonaka explain that this gives teams “an element of tension” necessary to “carry out a project of strategic importance to the company.” 

# Self-organizing teams
[Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) Teams were intended to operate like their own start-up, with a unique order that lacks true hierarchy. These teams are considered self-organizing when they exhibit autonomy, continuous growth, and collaboration.  

# Overlapping development phases
Individuals on a [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) Team must “work toward synchronizing their pace to meet deadlines.” At some point throughout the process, each individual’s pace starts to overlap with others, and eventually, a collective pace is formed within the team.

# Multi-learning
Scrum is a framework that relies heavily on trial and error. [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) Team members also aim to stay up-to-date with changing market conditions and can then respond quickly to those conditions. 

# Subtle control
As we mentioned, [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) Teams are self-organizing and operate like a start-up, but that doesn’t mean there is no structure at all. By creating checkpoints throughout the project to analyze team interactions and progress, Scrum Teams maintain control without hindering creativity. 

# Organizational transfer of learning
On [Scrum](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/scrum.md) teams, everyone is encouraged to learn skills that may be new to them as they support other team members.
