title: Velocity
---
The measure of how many points the team burns down in a given [Sprint](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/sprint.md).

Often calculated as the average of the last three sprints. 

It is impossible to compare teams' velocity, as it strictly depends on the calibration of the [Estimates](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/estimates.md#Relative estimations)

Once you have a stable velocity, you can say to [Stakeholders](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/stakeholders.md):
- How long it will take to complete the entire [Product backlog](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-backlog.md)
- How much of your [Product backlog](danielesalvatore/project-management/agile-project-management/scrum/product-backlog.md) will be completed by a particular time.

- Be careful when sharing velocity with external [Stakeholders](danielesalvatore/project-management/foundations-of-project-management/actors/stakeholders.md), as velocity is different for every team and cannot be compared
- Don't use velocity as a performance metric
- Don't use velocity as a comparison metric
- Proceed with caution when using velocity as a metric for project delivery date
