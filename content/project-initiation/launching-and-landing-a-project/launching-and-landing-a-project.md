title: Launching and landing a project
---


# Launch
Delivering the final result of your project to the client or user. 

## Landing
Measuring the success of your project using the success criteria established at the outset of the project.

For example, think about taking a trip on an airplane. It's not enough for the pilot to be able to get the plane off the ground. To arrive safely at your destination, they've got to know how to land.

Your success has to continue beyond the point of delivering the final project. You need to be able to measure whether the project functions as intended once it's put into practice.

# Launching vs. landing

It is not only important to launch a project but to confirm it is bringing the expected benefits. 

The evaluation includes the usage of the Success criteria and the final creation of business value.
