title: Statement of Work (SoW)
---
A document that clearly lays out the products and services a vendor or contractor will provide for the organization. 

It has to include Vendors and Organization needs.

The [Project manager](foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md) is tasked to compile the SoW, and he/she can ask for input from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). 
Legal Advisors overlook the project with the Project Manager.
