title: Maintaining a project budget
---
Monitoring the budget is crucial for a project manager to enforce accountability in terms of spending. 

[Milestones](project-planning/milestones.md) are a great opportuninty to re-review the budget, to identify if anything needs to be reset or revisited throughhout the project. 

Kind of contracts:
- [Fixed contracts](project-initiation/budget/fixed-contracts.md)
- [Time & materials contracts](project-initiation/budget/time-materials-contracts.md)

# Cost control
Practice where a project manager identifies factors that might impact their budget and then creates effective actions to minimize variances. ([Cost variance](project-initiation/budget/cost-variance.md))

- Establish a sign off plan and iform the appropriate stakeholders of any changes that occur
- Manage changes as they're made
- Accept that budget misses will happen
- Adequately account for, adapt, and manage your budget with that risk in mind
