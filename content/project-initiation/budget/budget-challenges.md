Challanges:
- Budget pre-allocation
- Inaccurately calculating Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
- [Scope creep](project-initiation/scope/scope-creep.md)

# Budget pre-allocation
- The budget is set before the start of the project.
- Working with stakeholders to define the scope and deliverables within the budget is vital.
- It is essential to monitor the budget regularly, as it cannot be exceeded.

# Inaccurately calculating Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
- Underestimate the costs of a project once launched

# Scope creep
- [Scope creep](project-initiation/scope/scope-creep.md)
