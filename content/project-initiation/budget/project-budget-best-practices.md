Best practice:
-   Reference historical data 
-   Utilize your team, mentors, or manager
-   Time-phase your budget 
-   Check, check, and double-check

#  Reference historical data 
- Your project may be similar to a previous project your organization has worked on. It is important to review how that projectâ€™s budget was handled, find out what went well and learn from any previous mistakes.
# Utilize your team, mentors, or manager
-  Get into the habit of asking for your team to double-check your work to give you additional sets of eyes on your documents.
# Time-phase your budget 
- Time-phased budgeting allows you to allocate costs for project tasks over the projected timeline in which those expenses are planned to take place. By looking at your tasks against a timeline, you can track and compare planned versus actual costs over time and manage changes to your budget as necessary.
# Check, check, and double-check
- Make sure that your budget is accurate and error-free. Your budget will likely require approval from another department, such as finance or senior management, so do your best to ensure that it is as straightforward to understand as possible and that all of your calculations are correct.
