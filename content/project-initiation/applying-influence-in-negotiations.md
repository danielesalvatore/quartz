# Coalition
A temporary alliance or partnering of individuals or groups in order to achieve a common purpose or to engage in a joint activity. 
Simplify the execution of [Steps to effective influencing](project-execution/effective-teams/steps-to-effective-influencing.md).

When two or more people advocate together for an idea, they're able to exert more influence than if they attempted to act alone. 

- Boost your credibility
- Find common ground and provide evidence.
- Con connect emotionally

An effective coalition includes people with the right mix of influence or power and interest.

Use [Stakeholder analysis](project-initiation/stakeholder-analysis/stakeholder-analysis.md) to identify who can be part of a coalition, picking stakeholders with a high level of power in the organization to help influence and get things done.

# Persuasive coalition request
- Clearly state the issue.
- Ask the person for their support. 
- Refer to the source of power you identified for that person.
