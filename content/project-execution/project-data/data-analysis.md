It is the collection of [Data](project-execution/project-data/data.md) in order to draw conclusions and make data-informed decisions.

Data by itself wonâ€™t help make data-informed decisions. A [Project manager](foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md) must analyze the data to draw conclusions and make predictions.
