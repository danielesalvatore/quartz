Though the needs and requests of your [Stakeholders](foundations-of-project-management/actors/stakeholders.md) are crucial to the project’s success, there may come a time when you, as [Project manager](foundations-of-project-management/actors/project-manager/project-manager.md), will need to prioritize the needs of your team over the wants of your stakeholders. 

This is called providing “air cover” for your team, and it is an important part of managing a project.
