title: Techniques to help manage risks
---
If you can manage [Change](project-execution/change.md), [Tasks dependencies](project-planning/estimations/tasks-dependencies.md), and [Scope creep](project-initiation/scope/scope-creep.md) other types of risks become much easier to manage.

If your dependencies are met on time, your team is less likely to fall behind schedule. If your scope is tightly-managed, you're less likely to incur changes to your budget or be forced to extend your timeline.

- Accepted
	- Understand and accept the risk for what it is, because it can't be resolved.
- Mitigated
