# Intentional
- Cleary stated purpose and expectations
- Everyone understands why they're meeting

Your meeting's purpose, or goal, describes the reason you're meeting and what you'd like to achieve. 

Send any pre-reading materials in advance of the meeting, so that everyone shows up prepared to participate. 

# Collaborative
People working together on an activity.

Let everyone know that they're encouraged or welcome to respond verbally, through chat, in the meeting notes, or in other formats you'd like to include. 

# Inclusive
The practice or policy of including people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized. 

Leave space in the meeting for participants who've been quiet. 

A key component of inclusivity is ensuring that your meetings and presentations are accessible.
