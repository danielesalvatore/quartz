title: Effective communication
---
You'll need to communicate certain information to your team multiple times and in various ways.

- Some people learn by listening
- Some people learn by watching
- Some people learn by doing

Questions to ask yourself:
- Who are your stakeholders?
-  What details are most important to them? 
- Are there project details that they might disagree with?

Project managers deliver value through effective communication, both with their [Team](foundations-of-project-management/actors/team.md) and with key [Stakeholders](foundations-of-project-management/actors/stakeholders.md).

To be effective, your team communication needs to be clear, honest, relevant, and frequent.
