Principles:
- State what you want clearly.
- Keep the content short and concise.
- Structure your writing.
- Check grammar, punctuation, and spelling.

# State what you want clearly.
- When you set out to compose an email, it is because there is something that you want from your reader.
- Before composing an email, think about what you want, when you need what you want, and the best way to get what you want when you want it.
	- Include your request in the subject line of your email.
	- State your request within the first two paragraphs of your email message.
	- Indicate the specific call-to-action associated with your request (for example, reply, review, RSVP).
	- Write clear, concise sentences when providing details.
	- Define terms. Avoid using acronyms and terminology that users may not know. Provide additional information as necessary to avoid misunderstanding. 

# Keep the content short and concise.
- Summarize the content you want to convey, and remove anything in your email that doesn’t contribute to your goal.
- Aim to write “question-less” and “self-standing” emails. This means that the message contains enough information to stand on its own. The reader shouldn’t have any questions about what you want and when you want it.
- Know your audience. Some people—such as executives and other busy leadership—may not want to read emails of more than a few sentences or click on external links for further information. Try to tailor your emails accordingly.

# Structure your writing.
- Use bullets. Bullets break up the visual flow. If you have more than one of something, consider using bullets. Write strong action verbs at the start of each bullet.
- Use labels. Labels help guide the reader to what information is most important. 
- Add hyperlinks. Hyperlinks allow readers to directly access additional information, rather than adding lengthy details to your email.
- Write a strong topic sentence. Place the main idea of the paragraph in the topic sentence. 
- 
# Check grammar, punctuation, and spelling.
