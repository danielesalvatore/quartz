## How to communicate changes to the team
When communicating a small change that will affect an individual, it's a good idea to send an email. 

When there's a big change within your project that impacts more than one person and is likely to change the budget, deadline, or scope of a project, you'll want to have a team meeting. 

### Timeout
Taking a moment away from the project in order to take a breath, regroup, and adjust the game plan. 

### Retrospective
A meeting focused on identifying the contributing causes of an incident or pattern of incidents without blaming any individual.
